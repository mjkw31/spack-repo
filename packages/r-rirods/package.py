	"""R Client for 'iRODS'

	The open sourced data management software 'Integrated Rule-Oriented 
	Data System' ('iRODS') offers solutions for the whole data life cycle 
	(<https://irods.org/>). The loosely constructed and highly configurable 
	architecture of 'iRODS' frees the user from strict formatting constraints 
	and single-vendor solutions. This package provides an interface to the 
	'iRODS' REST API, allowing you to manage your data and metadata in 'iRODS' 
	with R. Storage of annotated files and R objects in 'iRODS' ensures 
	findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data.
