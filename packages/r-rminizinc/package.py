	"""R Interface to 'MiniZinc'

	Constraint optimization, or constraint programming, is the name given to identifying
  feasible solutions out of a very large set of candidates, where the problem can be modeled in terms 
  of arbitrary constraints. 'MiniZinc' is a free and open-source constraint modeling language. 
  Constraint satisfaction and discrete optimization problems can be formulated in a high-level 
  modeling language. Models are compiled into an intermediate representation that is understood by a
  wide range of solvers. 'MiniZinc' itself provides several solvers, for instance 'GeCode'. R users 
  can use the package to solve constraint programming problems without using 'MiniZinc' directly, 
  modify existing 'MiniZinc' models and also create their own models.
