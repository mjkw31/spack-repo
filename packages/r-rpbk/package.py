class RRpbk(RPackage):
	"""Inference and Prediction of Generic Physiologically-Based
Kinetic Models

	Fit and simulate any kind of
	physiologically-based kinetic ('PBK') models whatever the number of compartments.
	Moreover, it allows to account for any link between pairs of compartments, as
	well as any link of each of the compartments with the external medium. Such
	generic PBK models have today applications in pharmacology (PBPK models) to
	describe drug effects, in toxicology and ecotoxicology (PBTK models) to describe
	chemical substance effects. In case of exposure to a parent compound (drug or
	chemical) the 'rPBK' package allows to consider metabolites, whatever their number
	and their phase (I, II, ...). Last but not least, package 'rPBK' can also be used for
	dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) to deal with metabolic networks. See also
	Charles et al. (2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.04.29.490045>.
