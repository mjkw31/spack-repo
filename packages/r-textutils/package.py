	"""Utilities for Handling Strings and Text

	Utilities for handling character vectors
  that store human-readable text (either plain or with
  markup, such as HTML or LaTeX). The package provides,
  in particular, functions that help with the

  and aligning strings that form the lines of such
  reports. The package also provides generic functions for
  transforming R objects to HTML and to plain text.
