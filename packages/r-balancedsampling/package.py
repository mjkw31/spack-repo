class RBalancedsampling(RPackage):
	"""Balanced and Spatially Balanced Sampling

	Select balanced and spatially balanced probability samples in multi-dimensional spaces 
    with any prescribed inclusion probabilities. It contains fast (C++ via Rcpp) implementations of 
    the included sampling methods. The local pivotal method by Grafström, Lundström and Schelin (2012)
    <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01699.x> and spatially correlated Poisson sampling by Grafström (2012) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2011.07.003> are included. Also the cube method (for balanced sampling) and 
    the local cube method (for doubly balanced sampling) are included, see Grafström and Tillé (2013) 
    <doi:10.1002/env.2194>.
