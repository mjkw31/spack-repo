	"""Selecting the Best Set of Relevant Environmental Variables along
with the Optimal Regularization Multiplier for Maxent Niche
Modeling

	Complex niche models show low performance in identifying
	the most important range-limiting environmental variables and in
	transferring habitat suitability to novel environmental conditions
	(Warren and Seifert, 2011 <DOI:10.1890/10-1171.1>; Warren et al.,
	2014 <DOI:10.1111/ddi.12160>). This package helps to identify the
	most important set of uncorrelated variables and to fine-tune Maxent's
	regularization multiplier. In combination, this allows to constrain
	complexity and increase performance of Maxent niche models (assessed
	by information criteria, such as AICc (Akaike, 1974
	<DOI:10.1109/TAC.1974.1100705>), and by the area under the receiver
	operating characteristic (AUC) (Fielding and Bell, 1997
	<DOI:10.1017/S0376892997000088>). Users of this package should be
	familiar with Maxent niche modelling.
