	"""Programming with Big Data -- Interface to 'ZeroMQ'.

	'ZeroMQ' is a well-known library for high-performance asynchronous
	messaging in scalable, distributed applications. This package provides high
	level R wrapper functions to easily utilize 'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on
	interactive client/server programming frameworks. For convenience, a
	minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.1.0 rc1) is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be
	used if no system installation of 'ZeroMQ' is available. A few wrapper
	functions compatible with 'rzmq' are also provided."""
