class RPartykit(RPackage):
	"""A Toolkit for Recursive Partytioning.

	A toolkit with infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and
	visualizing tree-structured regression and classification models. This
	unified infrastructure can be used for reading/coercing tree models from
	different sources ('rpart', 'RWeka', 'PMML') yielding objects that share
	functionality for print()/plot()/predict() methods. Furthermore, new and
	improved reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree()) and
	model-based recursive partitioning (mob()) from the 'party' package are
	provided based on the new infrastructure. A description of this package was
	published by Hothorn and Zeileis (2015)
	<https://jmlr.org/papers/v16/hothorn15a.html>."""
