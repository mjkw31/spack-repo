	"""Learn Text 'Embeddings' with 'Starspace'

	Wraps the 'StarSpace' library <https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace> 
	allowing users to calculate word, sentence, article, document, webpage, link and entity 'embeddings'. 
	By using the 'embeddings', you can perform text based multi-label classification, 
	find similarities between texts and categories, do collaborative-filtering based recommendation 
	as well as content-based recommendation, find out relations between entities, calculate 
	graph 'embeddings' as well as perform semi-supervised learning and multi-task learning on plain text. 
	The techniques are explained in detail in the paper: 'StarSpace: Embed All The Things!' by Wu et al. (2017), available at <arXiv:1709.03856>.
