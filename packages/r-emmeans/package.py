	"""Estimated Marginal Means, aka Least-Squares Means.

	Obtain estimated marginal means (EMMs) for many linear, generalized linear,
	and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions of EMMs, trends,
	and comparisons of slopes. Plots and other displays.  Least-squares means
	are discussed, and the term "estimated marginal means" is suggested, in
	Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) Population marginal means in the linear
	model: An alternative to least squares means, The American Statistician
	34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>."""
