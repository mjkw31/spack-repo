	"""Randomized Singular Value Decomposition Algorithms with
'RcppEigen'

	Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) methods proposed in the 'PCAone' paper by Li (2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.05.25.493261>, where we implement and propose two RSVD methods. One is based on Yu (2017) <arXiv:1704.07669> single pass RSVD but with power iteration scheme. The other is our new window based RSVD.
