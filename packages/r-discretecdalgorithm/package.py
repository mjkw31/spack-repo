class RDiscretecdalgorithm(RPackage):
	"""Coordinate-Descent Algorithm for Learning Sparse Discrete
Bayesian Networks

	Structure learning of Bayesian network using coordinate-descent
	algorithm. This algorithm is designed for discrete network assuming a multinomial data set,
	and we use a multi-logit model to do the regression.
	The algorithm is described in Gu, Fu and Zhou (2016) <arXiv:1403.2310>.
