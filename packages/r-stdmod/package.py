class RStdmod(RPackage):
	"""Standardized Moderation Effect and Its Confidence Interval

	Functions for computing a standardized moderation effect
             in moderated regression and forming its confidence interval
             by nonparametric bootstrapping as proposed in
             Cheung, Cheung, Lau, Hui, and Vong (2022)
             <doi:10.1037/hea0001188>. Also includes simple-to-use
             functions for computing conditional effects (unstandardized
             or standardized) and plotting moderation effects.
