class RLifecycle(RPackage):
	"""Manage the Life Cycle of your Package Functions.

	Manage the life cycle of your exported functions with shared conventions,
	documentation badges, and non-invasive deprecation warnings. The
	'lifecycle' package defines four development stages (experimental,
	maturing, stable, and questioning) and three deprecation stages
	(soft-deprecated, deprecated, and defunct). It makes it easy to insert
	badges corresponding to these stages in your documentation. Usage of
	deprecated functions are signalled with increasing levels of non-invasive
	verbosity."""
