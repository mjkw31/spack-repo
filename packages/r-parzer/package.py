	"""Parse Messy Geographic Coordinates

	Parse messy geographic coordinates from various character formats
	to decimal degree numeric values. Parse coordinates into
	their parts (degree, minutes, seconds); calculate hemisphere
	from coordinates; pull out individually degrees,
	minutes, or seconds; add and subtract degrees, minutes,
	and seconds. C++ code herein originally inspired from code
	written by Jeffrey D. Bogan, but then completely re-written.
