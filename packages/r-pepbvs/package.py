	"""Bayesian Variable Selection using Power-Expected-Posterior Prior

	Performs Bayesian variable selection under normal linear
		  models for the data with the model parameters following as prior either 
		  the power-expected-posterior (PEP) or the intrinsic (a special case of the former)
		  (Fouskakis and Ntzoufras (2022) <doi: 10.1214/21-BA1288>,
		  Fouskakis and Ntzoufras (2020) <doi: 10.3390/econometrics8020017>).		  
		  The prior distribution on model space is the uniform on model space
		  or the uniform on model dimension (a special case of the beta-binomial prior). 
		  The selection can be done either with full enumeration of all 
		  possible models or using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Model Composition (MC3) 
		  algorithm (Madigan and York (1995) <doi: 10.2307/1403615>). 
		  Complementary functions for making predictions, as well as plotting and 
		  printing the results are also provided.
