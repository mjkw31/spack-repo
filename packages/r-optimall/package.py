class ROptimall(RPackage):
	"""Allocate Samples Among Strata

	Functions for the design process of survey sampling, with specific tools for multi-wave and multi-phase designs. Perform optimum allocation using Neyman (1934) <doi:10.2307/2342192> or Wright (2012) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2012.733679> allocation, split strata based on quantiles or values of known variables, randomly select samples from strata, allocate sampling waves iteratively, and organize a complex survey design. Also includes a Shiny application for observing the effects of different strata splits.
