class RTinythemes(RPackage):
	"""Lightweight Repackaging of 'Themes' for 'ggplot2'

	Themes for 'ggplot2' are a convenient way to style plots. The 'hrbrthemes' package
 contains a particularly nice one, but brings along a significant tail of dependencies. So this
 (currently experimental) package brings along just the 'theme_ipsum_rc' theme using the 'Roboto'
 'Condensed' font.  Should the font not be installed on your system, see the help in the package
 'hrbrthemes' on how on install 'Roboto Condensed'.
