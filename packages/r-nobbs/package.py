	"""Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing

	A Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. 'NobBS' learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings, as described in McGough et al. (2020) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007735>.
