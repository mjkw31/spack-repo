class RB64(RPackage):
	"""Fast and Vectorized Base 64 Engine

	Provides a fast, lightweight, and vectorized base 64 engine
	to encode and decode character and raw vectors as well as files stored
	on disk.  Common base 64 alphabets are supported out of the box
	including the standard, URL-safe, bcrypt, crypt, 'BinHex', and
	IMAP-modified UTF-7 alphabets. Custom engines can be created to
	support unique base 64 encoding and decoding needs.
