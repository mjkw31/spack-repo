class RRcppbigintalgos(RPackage):
	"""Factor Big Integers with the Parallel Quadratic Sieve

	Features the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve (MPQS) algorithm
	for factoring large integers and a vectorized factoring function that
	returns the complete factorization of an integer. The MPQS is based off of
	the seminal work of Carl Pomerance (1984) <doi:10.1007/3-540-39757-4_17>
	along with the modification of multiple polynomials introduced by Peter
	Montgomery and J. Davis as outlined by Robert D. Silverman (1987)
	<doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-1987-0866119-8>. Utilizes the C library
	GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic). For smaller integers, a simple
	Elliptic Curve algorithm is attempted followed by a constrained version of 
	Pollard's rho algorithm. The Pollard's rho algorithm is the same algorithm
	used by the factorize function in the 'gmp' package.
