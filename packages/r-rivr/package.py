	"""Steady and Unsteady Open-Channel Flow Computation

	A tool for undergraduate and graduate courses in open-channel
    hydraulics. Provides functions for computing normal and critical depths,
    steady-state water surface profiles (e.g. backwater curves) and unsteady flow
    computations (e.g. flood wave routing) as described in
    Koohafkan MC, Younis BA (2015). "Open-channel computation with R."
    The R Journal, 7(2), 249â€“262. <doi: 10.32614/RJ-2015-034>.
