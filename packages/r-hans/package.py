	"""Haversines are not Slow

	The haversine is a function used to calculate the distance between a pair of 
    latitude and longitude points while accounting for the assumption that the points 
    are on a spherical globe. This package provides a fast, dataframe compatible, 
    haversine function. For the first publication on the haversine calculation see 
    Joseph de Mendoza y RÃ­os (1795) <https://books.google.cat/books?id=030t0OqlX2AC> (In Spanish).
