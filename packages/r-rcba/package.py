class RRcba(RPackage):
	"""CBA Classifier

	Provides implementations of a classifier based on the
	"Classification Based on Associations" (CBA). It can be used for building
	classification models from association rules. Rules are pruned in the order of
	precedence given by the sort criteria and a default rule is added. The final
	classifier labels provided instances. CBA was originally proposed by Liu,
	B. Hsu, W. and Ma, Y. Integrating Classification and Association Rule
	Mining. Proceedings KDD-98, New York, 27-31 August. AAAI. pp80-86 (1998, ISBN:1-57735-070-7).
