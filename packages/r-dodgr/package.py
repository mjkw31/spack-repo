	"""Distances on Directed Graphs

	Distances on dual-weighted directed graphs using
	priority-queue shortest paths (Padgham (2019) <doi:10.32866/6945>).
	Weighted directed graphs have weights from A to B which may differ
	from those from B to A.  Dual-weighted directed graphs have two sets
	of such weights. A canonical example is a street network to be used
	for routing in which routes are calculated by weighting distances
	according to the type of way and mode of transport, yet lengths of
	routes must be calculated from direct distances.
