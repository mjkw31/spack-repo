class RNeptune(RPackage):
	"""MLOps Metadata Store - Experiment Tracking and Model Registry
for Production Teams

	An interface to Neptune. A metadata store for MLOps, built for teams that run a lot of experiments.
	It gives you a single place to log, store, display, organize, compare, and query all your model-building metadata.
	Neptune is used for:
	• Experiment tracking: Log, display, organize, and compare ML experiments in a single place.
	• Model registry: Version, store, manage, and query trained models, and model building metadata.
	• Monitoring ML runs live: Record and monitor model training, evaluation, or production runs live
	For more information see <https://neptune.ai/>.
