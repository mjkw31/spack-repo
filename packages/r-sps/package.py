	"""Sequential Poisson Sampling

	Sequential Poisson sampling is a variation of Poisson sampling for drawing probability-proportional-to-size samples with a given number of units, and is commonly used for price-index surveys. This package gives functions to draw stratified sequential Poisson samples according to the method by Ohlsson (1998, ISSN:0282-423X), as well as other order sample designs by Ros√©n (1997, <doi:10.1016/S0378-3758(96)00186-3>), and generate appropriate bootstrap replicate weights according to the generalized bootstrap method by Beaumont and Patak (2012, <doi:10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00166.x>).
