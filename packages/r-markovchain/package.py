class RMarkovchain(RPackage):
	"""Easy Handling Discrete Time Markov Chains

	Functions and S4 methods to create and manage discrete time Markov
	chains more easily. In addition functions to perform statistical (fitting
	and drawing random variates) and probabilistic (analysis of their structural
	proprieties) analysis are provided. See Spedicato (2017) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2017-036>.
	Some functions for continuous times Markov chains depends on the suggested ctmcd package, that, 
	as May 2023, can be retrieved from <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ctmcd/ctmcd_1.4.2.tar.gz>.
