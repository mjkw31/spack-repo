Renyi Transfer Entropy

	Measuring information flow between time series with Shannon and RÃ©nyi transfer entropy. See also Dimpfl and Peter (2013) <doi:10.1515/snde-2012-0044> and Dimpfl and Peter (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.intfin.2014.03.004> for theory and applications to financial time series. Additional references can be found in the theory part of the vignette.
