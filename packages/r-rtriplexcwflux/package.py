	A carbon-water coupled model (TRIPLEX-CW-Flux) is based on two well-established models, TRIPLEX-Flux model and Penmanâ€“Monteith model, integrates soil water and water vapor pressure deficits into the stomata conductance submodule to estimate net ecosystem production and evapotranspiration in forest ecosystems.<https://github.com/ShulanSun/rTRIPLEX_CW_Flux>.
