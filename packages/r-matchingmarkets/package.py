class RMatchingmarkets(RPackage):
	"""Analysis of Stable Matchings

	Implements structural estimators to correct for
	the sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching
	markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents into groups 
	(Klein, 2015) <https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/research-files/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe1521.pdf> 
	as well as two-sided matching of students to schools 
	(Aue et al., 2020) <https://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp20032.pdf>.
	The package also contains algorithms to find stable matchings
	in the three most common matching problems: the stable roommates
	problem (Irving, 1985) <doi:10.1016/0196-6774(85)90033-1>, 
	the college admissions problem (Gale and Shapley, 1962) <doi:10.2307/2312726>, 
	and the house allocation problem (Shapley and Scarf, 1974) <doi:10.1016/0304-4068(74)90033-0>.
