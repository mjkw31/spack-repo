class RNdjson(RPackage):
	"""Wicked-Fast Streaming 'JSON' ('ndjson') Reader

	Streaming 'JSON' ('ndjson') has one 'JSON' record per-line
		and many modern 'ndjson' files contain large numbers of records.
		These constructs may not be columnar in nature, but it is often
		useful to read in these files and "flatten" the structure out to
		enable working with the data in an R 'data.frame'-like context.
		Functions are provided that make it possible to read in plain
		'ndjson' files or compressed ('gz') 'ndjson' files and either
		validate the format of the records or create "flat" 'data.table'
		structures from them.
