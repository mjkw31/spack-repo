class REddington(RPackage):
	"""Compute a Cyclist's Eddington Number

	Compute a cyclist's Eddington number, including efficiently
	computing cumulative E over a vector. A cyclist's Eddington number
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling>
	is the maximum number satisfying the condition such that a cyclist has
	ridden E miles or greater on E distinct days. The algorithm in this package
	is an improvement over the conventional approach because both summary
	statistics and cumulative statistics can be computed in linear time, since
	it does not require initial sorting of the data. These functions may also be
	used for computing h-indices for authors, a metric described by Hirsch (2005)
	<doi:10.1073/pnas.0507655102>. Both are specific applications of computing
	the side length of a Durfee square <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durfee_square>.
