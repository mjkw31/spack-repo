	"""Baffling Recursive Algorithm for Isotope distributioN calculations

	Package for calculating aggregated isotopic distribution and exact center-masses for chemical substances (in this version composed of C, H, N, O and S). This is an implementation of the BRAIN algorithm described in the paper by J. Claesen, P. Dittwald, T. Burzykowski and D. Valkenborg.
