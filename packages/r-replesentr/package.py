	"""Presentations in the REPL

	Create presentations and display them inside the R 'REPL'
	(Read-Eval-Print loop), aka the R console. Presentations can be written in
	'RMarkdown' or any other text format. A set of convenient navigation options
	as well as code evaluation during a presentation is provided. It is great
	for tech talks with live coding examples and tutorials. While this is not a
	replacement for standard presentation formats, it's old-school looks might
	just be what sets it apart. This project has been inspired by the
	'REPLesent' project for presentations in the 'Scala' 'REPL'.
