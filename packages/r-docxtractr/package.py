	"""Extract Data Tables and Comments from 'Microsoft' 'Word'
Documents

	'Microsoft Word' 'docx' files provide an 'XML' structure that is fairly
	straightforward to navigate, especially when it applies to 'Word' tables and
	comments. Tools are provided to determine table count/structure, comment count
	and also to extract/clean tables and comments from 'Microsoft Word' 'docx' documents.
	There is also nascent support for '.doc' and '.pptx' files.
