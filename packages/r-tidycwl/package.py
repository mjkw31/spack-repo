	"""Tidy Common Workflow Language Tools and Workflows

	The Common Workflow Language <https://www.commonwl.org/> is an
	open standard for describing data analysis workflows. This package takes
	the raw Common Workflow Language workflows encoded in JSON or 'YAML'
	and turns the workflow elements into tidy data frames or lists.
	A graph representation for the workflow can be constructed and visualized
	with the parsed workflow inputs, outputs, and steps. Users can embed the
	visualizations in their 'Shiny' applications, and export them
	as HTML files or static images.
