class RGlycanr(RPackage):
	"""Tools for Analysing N-Glycan Data

	Useful utilities in N-glycan data analysis. This package tries
    to fill the gap in N-glycan data analysis by providing easy
    to use functions for basic operations on data
    (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycomics> for more
    details on Glycomics). At the moment 'glycanr' is mostly oriented
    to data obtained by UPLC (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography)
    and LCMS (Liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry)
    analysis of Plasma and IgG glycome.
