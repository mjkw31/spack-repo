	"""WordNet Interface

	An interface to WordNet using the Jawbone Java API to WordNet.
  WordNet (<https://wordnet.princeton.edu/>) is a large lexical database of
  English.  Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of
  cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.  Synsets
  are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.
  Please note that WordNet(R) is a registered tradename.  Princeton
  University makes WordNet available to research and commercial users
  free of charge provided the terms of their license
  (<https://wordnet.princeton.edu/license-and-commercial-use>) are followed,
  and proper reference is made to the project using an appropriate
  citation (<https://wordnet.princeton.edu/citing-wordnet>).
