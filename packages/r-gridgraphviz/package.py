class RGridgraphviz(RPackage):
	"""Drawing Graphs with 'grid'

	Functions for drawing node-and-edge graphs that have been 
			  laid out by 'graphviz'.  This provides an alternative 
			  rendering to that provided by the 'Rgraphviz' package, with
			  two main advantages:  the rendering provided by 'gridGraphviz'
			  should be more similar to what 'graphviz' itself would draw;
			  and rendering with 'grid' allows for post-hoc customisations
			  using the named viewports and grobs that 'gridGraphviz'
			  produces.
