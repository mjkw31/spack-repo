class RBeastjar(RPackage):
	"""JAR Dependency for MCMC Using 'BEAST'

	Provides JAR to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference using
	the popular Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees 'BEAST' software library
	of Suchard et al (2018) <doi:10.1093/ve/vey016>. 'BEAST' supports auto-tuning
	Metropolis-Hastings, slice, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo
	sampling for a large variety of composable standard and phylogenetic statistical
	models using high performance computing.  By placing the 'BEAST' JAR in this package,
	we offer an efficient distribution system for 'BEAST' use by other R packages using
	CRAN.
