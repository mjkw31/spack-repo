class RPedmod(RPackage):
	"""Pedigree Models

	Provides functions to estimate mixed probit models using, for 
	instance, pedigree data like in <doi:10.1002/sim.1603>. The models are also 
	commonly called liability threshold models. The approximation is 
	based on direct log marginal likelihood approximations like the randomized 
	Quasi-Monte Carlo suggested by <doi:10.1198/106186002394> with a similar 
	procedure to approximate the derivatives. The minimax tilting method 
	suggested by <doi:10.1111/rssb.12162> is also supported. Graph-based methods 
	are also provided that can be used to simplify pedigrees.
