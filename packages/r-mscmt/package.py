	"""Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series

	Three generalizations of the synthetic control method (which has 
    already an implementation in package 'Synth') are implemented: first, 
    'MSCMT' allows for using multiple outcome variables, second, time series 
    can be supplied as economic predictors, and third, a well-defined 
    cross-validation approach can be used.
    Much effort has been taken to make the implementation as stable as possible 
    (including edge cases) without losing computational efficiency.
    A detailed description of the main algorithms is given in 
    Becker and Klößner (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2017.08.002>.
