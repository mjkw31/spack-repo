class RTikzdevice(RPackage):
	"""R Graphics Output in LaTeX Format

	Provides a graphics output device for R that records plots
		in a LaTeX-friendly format. The device transforms plotting
		commands issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks. When
		included in a LaTeX document, these blocks are interpreted with
		the help of 'TikZ'---a graphics package for TeX and friends
		written by Till Tantau. Using the 'tikzDevice', the text of R
		plots can contain LaTeX commands such as mathematical formula.
		The device also allows arbitrary LaTeX code to be inserted into
		the output stream.
