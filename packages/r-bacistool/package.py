	"""Bayesian Classification and Information Sharing (BaCIS) Tool for
the Design of Multi-Group Phase II Clinical Trials

	Provides the design of multi-group phase
	II clinical trials with binary outcomes using the hierarchical Bayesian
	classification and information sharing (BaCIS) model. Subgroups are classified
	into two clusters on the basis of their outcomes mimicking the hypothesis
	testing framework. Subsequently, information sharing takes place within
	subgroups in the same cluster, rather than across all subgroups. This method can
	be applied to the design and analysis of multi-group clinical trials with binary
	outcomes. Reference: Nan Chen and J. Jack Lee (2019) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700275>.
