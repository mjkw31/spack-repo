	"""Statistical Inference for Box-Cox Based Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curves

	Generation of Box-Cox based ROC curves and several aspects of inferences and hypothesis testing. Can be used when inferences for one biomarker (Bantis LE, Nakas CT, Reiser B. (2018) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700107>) are of interest or when comparisons of two correlated biomarkers (Bantis LE, Nakas CT, Reiser B. (2021) <doi:10.1002/bimj.202000128>) are of interest. Provides inferences and comparisons around the AUC, the Youden index, the sensitivity at a given specificity level (and vice versa), the optimal operating point of the ROC curve (in the Youden sense), and the Youden based cutoff.
