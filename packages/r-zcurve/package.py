class RZcurve(RPackage):
	"""An Implementation of Z-Curves

	An implementation of z-curves - a method for estimating expected discovery 
    and replicability rates on the bases of test-statistics of published studies. The package 
    provides functions for fitting the new density and EM version 
    (Barto≈° & Schimmack, 2020, <doi:10.31234/osf.io/urgtn>), censored observations,  
    as well as the original density z-curve (Brunner & Schimmack, 2020, <doi:10.15626/MP.2018.874>). 
    Furthermore, the package provides summarizing and plotting functions for the fitted z-curve objects. 
    See the aforementioned articles for more information about the z-curves, expected discovery 
    and replicability rates, validation studies, and limitations.
