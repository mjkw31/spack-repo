	"""Compiling Bioconductor to Handle Each Matrix Type.

	Provides a consistent C++ class interface for reading from and writing
	data to a variety of commonly used matrix types. Ordinary matrices and
	several sparse/dense Matrix classes are directly supported, third-party
	S4 classes may be supported by external linkage, while all other
	matrices are handled by DelayedArray block processing."""
