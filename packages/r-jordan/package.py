class RJordan(RPackage):
	"""A Suite of Routines for Working with Jordan Algebras

	A Jordan algebra is an algebraic object originally
   designed to study observables in quantum mechanics.  Jordan
   algebras are commutative but non-associative; they satisfy the
   Jordan identity.  The package follows the ideas and notation of
   K. McCrimmon (2004, ISBN:0-387-95447-3) "A Taste of Jordan
   Algebras".
