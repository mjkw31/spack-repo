class RBspm(RPackage):
	"""Bridge to System Package Manager

	Enables binary package installations on Linux distributions.
	Provides functions to manage packages via the distribution's package
	manager. Also provides transparent integration with R's install.packages()
	and a fallback mechanism. When installed as a system package, interacts
	with the system's package manager without requiring administrative
	privileges via an integrated D-Bus service; otherwise, uses sudo.
	Currently, the following backends are supported: DNF, APT, ALPM.
