	"""Online error rate control

	This package allows users to control the false discovery rate (FDR) or familywise error rate (FWER) for online multiple hypothesis testing, where hypotheses arrive in a stream. In this framework, a null hypothesis is rejected based on the evidence against it and on the previous rejection decisions.
