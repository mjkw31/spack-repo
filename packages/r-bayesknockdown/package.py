class RBayesknockdown(RPackage):
	"""BayesKnockdown: Posterior Probabilities for Edges from Knockdown Data

	A simple, fast Bayesian method for computing posterior probabilities for relationships between a single predictor variable and multiple potential outcome variables, incorporating prior probabilities of relationships. In the context of knockdown experiments, the predictor variable is the knocked-down gene, while the other genes are potential targets. Can also be used for differential expression/2-class data.
