class RS2net(RPackage):
	"""The Generalized Semi-Supervised Elastic-Net

	Implements the generalized semi-supervised elastic-net. This method extends the supervised elastic-net problem, and thus it is a practical solution to the problem of feature selection in semi-supervised contexts. Its mathematical formulation is presented from a general perspective, covering a wide range of models.  We focus on linear and logistic responses, but the implementation could be easily extended to other losses in generalized linear models. We develop a flexible and fast implementation, written in 'C++' using 'RcppArmadillo' and integrated into R via 'Rcpp' modules. See Culp, M. 2013 <doi:10.1080/10618600.2012.657139> for references on the Joint Trained Elastic-Net.
