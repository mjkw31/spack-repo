class RHdflex(RPackage):
	"""High-Dimensional Aggregate Density Forecasts

	Provides a forecasting method that maps vast numbers of
    (scalar-valued) signals of any type into an aggregate density forecast
    in a time-varying and computationally fast manner. The method proceeds
    in two steps: First, it transforms a predictive signal into a density
    forecast. Second, it combines the generated candidate density
    forecasts into an ultimate density forecast. The methods are explained
    in detail in Adaemmer et al. (2023) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4342487>.
