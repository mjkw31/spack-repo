	"""Robust Bayesian Variable Selection via Expectation-Maximization

	Variable selection methods have been extensively developed for analyzing high-dimensional omics data within both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. This package implemented the spike-and-slab quantile LASSO which has been developed along the line of Bayesian hierarchical model but deeply rooted in the frequentist regularization methods by utilizing the Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) algorithm. Therefore, the proposed method borrows strength from both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks while overcoming their respective limitations. The spike-and-slab quantile LASSO can handle data irregularity in terms of skewness and outliers in the disease trait, compared to its nonrobust alternative, the spike-and-slab LASSO, which has also been implemented in the package. The core module of this package is developed in 'C++'.
