	"""Diversity-Interactions (DI) Models

	The 'DImodels' package is suitable for analysing data from biodiversity and ecosystem function studies using the Diversity-Interactions (DI) modelling approach introduced by Kirwan et al. (2009) <doi:10.1890/08-1684.1>. Suitable data will contain proportions for each species and a community-level response variable, and may also include additional factors, such as blocks or treatments. The package can perform data manipulation tasks, such as computing pairwise interactions (the DI_data() function), can perform an automated model selection process (the autoDI() function) and has the flexibility to fit a wide range of user-defined DI models (the DI() function).
