class RProtolite(RPackage):
	"""Highly Optimized Protocol Buffer Serializers

	Pure C++ implementations for reading and writing several common data 
	formats based on Google protocol-buffers. Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for 
	serialized R objects, 'geobuf.proto' for binary geojson, and 'mvt.proto' for 
	vector tiles. This package uses the auto-generated C++ code by protobuf-compiler, 
	hence the entire serialization is optimized at compile time. The 'RProtoBuf' 
	package on the other hand uses the protobuf runtime library to provide a general-
	purpose toolkit for reading and writing arbitrary protocol-buffer data in R.
