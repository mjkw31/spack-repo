class RFastdigest(RPackage):
	"""Fast, Low Memory-Footprint Digests of R Objects.

	Provides an R interface to Bob Jenkin's streaming, non-cryptographic
	'SpookyHash' hash algorithm for use in digest-based comparisons of R
	objects. 'fastdigest' plugs directly into R's internal serialization
	machinery, allowing digests of all R objects the serialize() function
	supports, including reference-style objects via custom hooks. Speed is high
	and scales linearly by object size; memory usage is constant and
	negligible."""
