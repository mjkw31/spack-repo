class RGlmnet(RPackage):
	"""Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models.

	Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or elastic-net
	regularization path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial
	regression models, Poisson regression and the Cox model. Two recent
	additions are the multiple-response Gaussian, and the grouped multinomial.
	The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion, as
	described in the paper linked to via the URL below."""
