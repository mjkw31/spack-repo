class RStartr(RPackage):
	"""Automatically Retrieve Multidimensional Distributed Data Sets

	Tool to automatically fetch, transform and arrange subsets of
	multi- dimensional data sets (collections of files) stored in local and/or
	remote file systems or servers, using multicore capabilities where possible.
	The tool provides an interface to perceive a collection of data sets as a single
	large multidimensional data array, and enables the user to request for automatic
	retrieval, processing and arrangement of subsets of the large array. Wrapper
	functions to add support for custom file formats can be plugged in/out, making
	the tool suitable for any research field where large multidimensional data sets
	are involved.
