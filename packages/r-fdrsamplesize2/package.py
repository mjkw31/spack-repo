	"""Computing Power and Sample Size for the False Discovery Rate in
Multiple Applications

	Defines a collection of functions to compute average power and sample size for studies that use the false discovery rate as the final measure of statistical significance. A three-rectangle approximation method of a p-value histogram is proposed to derive a formula to compute the statistical power for analyses that involve the FDR. The methodology paper of this package is under review.
