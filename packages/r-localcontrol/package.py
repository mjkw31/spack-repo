class RLocalcontrol(RPackage):
	"""Nonparametric Methods for Generating High Quality Comparative
Effectiveness Evidence

	Implements novel nonparametric approaches to address
	biases and confounding when comparing treatments or exposures in
	observational studies of outcomes. While designed and appropriate for use
	in studies involving medicine and the life sciences, the package can be
	used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders.
	The package implements a family of methods for non-parametric bias correction
	when comparing treatments in observational studies, including survival
	analysis settings, where competing risks and/or censoring may be present.
	The approach extends to bias-corrected personalized predictions of treatment
	outcome differences, and analysis of heterogeneity of treatment effect-sizes
	across patient subgroups. For further details, please see:
