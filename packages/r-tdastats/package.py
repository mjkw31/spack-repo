class RTdastats(RPackage):
	"""Pipeline for Topological Data Analysis

	A comprehensive toolset for any
	useR conducting topological data analysis, specifically via the
	calculation of persistent homology in a Vietoris-Rips complex.
	The tools this package currently provides can be conveniently split
	into three main sections: (1) calculating persistent homology; (2)
	conducting statistical inference on persistent homology calculations;
	(3) visualizing persistent homology and statistical inference.
	The published form of TDAstats can be found in Wadhwa et al. (2018)
	<doi:10.21105/joss.00860>.   
	For a general background on computing persistent homology for
	topological data analysis, see Otter et al. (2017)
	<doi:10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0109-5>.
	To learn more about how the permutation test is used for
	nonparametric statistical inference in topological data analysis,
	read Robinson & Turner (2017) <doi:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7>.
	To learn more about how TDAstats calculates persistent homology,
	you can visit the GitHub repository for Ripser, the software that
	works behind the scenes at <https://github.com/Ripser/ripser>.
	This package has been published as Wadhwa et al. (2018)
	<doi:10.21105/joss.00860>.
