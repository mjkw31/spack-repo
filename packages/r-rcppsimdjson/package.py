class RRcppsimdjson(RPackage):
	"""'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'simdjson' Header-Only Library for
'JSON' Parsing

	The 'JSON' format is ubiquitous for data interchange, and the
 'simdjson' library written by Daniel Lemire (and many contributors) provides
 a high-performance parser for these files which by relying on parallel 'SIMD'
 instruction manages to parse these files as faster than disk speed. See the
 <arXiv:1902.08318> paper for more details about 'simdjson'.  This package
 parses 'JSON' from string, file, or remote URLs under a variety of settings.
