class RTexreg(RPackage):
	"""Conversion of R Regression Output to LaTeX or HTML Tables

	Converts coefficients, standard errors, significance stars, and goodness-of-fit statistics of statistical models into LaTeX tables or HTML tables/MS Word documents or to nicely formatted screen output for the R console for easy model comparison. A list of several models can be combined in a single table. The output is highly customizable. New model types can be easily implemented. Details can be found in Leifeld (2013), JStatSoft <doi:10.18637/jss.v055.i08>. (If the Zelig package, which this package enhances, cannot be found on CRAN, you can find it at <https://github.com/IQSS/Zelig>. If the mnlogit package, which this package enhances, cannot be found on CRAN, you can find an old version in the CRAN Archive at <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mnlogit/>.)
