class RPromises(RPackage):
	"""Abstractions for Promise-Based Asynchronous Programming.

	Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous programming in R
	using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful for allowing a single R
	process to orchestrate multiple tasks in the background while also
	attending to something else. Semantics are similar to 'JavaScript'
	promises, but with a syntax that is idiomatic R."""
