class RRsagacmd(RPackage):
	"""Linking R with the Open-Source 'SAGA-GIS' Software

	Provides an R scripting interface to the open-source 'SAGA-GIS' 
	(System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses Geographical Information
	System) software. 'Rsagacmd' dynamically generates R functions for every
	'SAGA-GIS' geoprocessing tool based on the user's currently installed
	'SAGA-GIS' version. These functions are contained within an S3 object
	and are accessed as a named list of libraries and tools. This structure
	facilitates an easier scripting experience by organizing the large number
	of 'SAGA-GIS' geoprocessing tools (>700) by their respective library.
	Interactive scripting can fully take advantage of code autocompletion tools
	(e.g. in 'Rstudio'), allowing for each tools syntax to be quickly
	recognized. Furthermore, the most common types of spatial data (via the
	'terra', 'sp', and 'sf' packages) along with non-spatial data are
	automatically passed from R to the 'SAGA-GIS' command line tool for
	geoprocessing operations, and the results are loaded as the appropriate R
	object. Outputs from individual 'SAGA-GIS' tools can also be chained using
	pipes from the 'magrittr' and 'dplyr' packages to combine complex
	geoprocessing operations together in a single statement. 'SAGA-GIS' is
	available under a GPLv2 / LGPLv2 licence from
	<https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/> including Windows x86/x64
	and macOS binaries. SAGA-GIS is also included in Debian/Ubuntu default software
	repositories. Rsagacmd has currently been tested on 'SAGA-GIS' versions
	from 2.3.1 to 9.2 on Windows, Linux and macOS.
