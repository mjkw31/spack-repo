class RMaldiquant(RPackage):
	"""Quantitative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data.

	A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
	desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other two-dimensional
	mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly used plotting and
	processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely baseline
	subtraction methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or the
	statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP),
	peak alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated measurements
	as well as allowing spectra with different resolutions."""
