class RBayesfm(RPackage):
	"""Bayesian Inference for Factor Modeling

	Collection of procedures to perform Bayesian analysis on a variety
	of factor models. Currently, it includes: "Bayesian Exploratory Factor 
	Analysis" (befa) from G. Conti, S. Fr√ºhwirth-Schnatter, J.J. Heckman, 
	R. Piatek (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2014.06.008>, an approach to 
	dedicated factor analysis with stochastic search on the structure of the 
	factor loading matrix. The number of latent factors, as well as the 
	allocation of the manifest variables to the factors, are not fixed a priori 
	but determined during MCMC sampling.
