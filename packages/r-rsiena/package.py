	"""Siena - Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis

	The main purpose of this package is to perform simulation-based
   estimation of stochastic actor-oriented models for longitudinal network
   data collected as panel data. Dependent variables can be single or
   multivariate networks, which can be directed, non-directed, or two-mode;
   and associated actor variables.
   There are also functions for testing parameters and checking goodness of fit.
   An overview of these models is given in Snijders (2017),
   <doi:10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-054035>.
