	"""Generate Music Easily and Show Them Anywhere

	Provides a simple and intuitive high-level language, with which
	you can create music easily. Takes care of all the dirty technical
	details in converting your music to musical scores and audio files.
	Works in 'R Markdown' documents <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>,
	R 'Jupyter Notebooks' <https://jupyter.org/>, and 'RStudio'
	<https://www.rstudio.com/>, so you can embed generated music
	anywhere. Internally, uses 'MusicXML' <https://www.musicxml.com/> to
	represent musical scores, and 'MuseScore' <https://musescore.org/> to
	convert 'MusicXML'.
