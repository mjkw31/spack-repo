	"""Optimal Transport for Gating Transfer in Cytometry Data with
Domain Adaptation

	Supervised learning from a source distribution (with known segmentation into cell sub-populations) 
			 to fit a target distribution with unknown segmentation. It relies regularized optimal transport to directly 
			 estimate the different cell population proportions from a biological sample characterized with flow cytometry 
			 measurements. It is based on the regularized Wasserstein metric to compare cytometry measurements from 
			 different samples, thus accounting for possible mis-alignment of a given cell population across sample 
			 (due to technical variability from the technology of measurements). Supervised learning technique based 
			 on the Wasserstein metric that is used to estimate an optimal re-weighting of class proportions in a 
			 mixture model Details are presented in Freulon P, Bigot J and Hejblum BP (2021) <arXiv:2006.09003>.
