	"""R Interface to 'FACTS' on Unix-Like Systems

	The 'rfacts' package is an R interface to the
  Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator ('FACTS')
  on Unix-like systems. It programmatically invokes 'FACTS' to run clinical
  trial simulations, and it aggregates simulation output data
  into tidy data frames. These capabilities provide end-to-end
  automation for large-scale simulation pipelines, and
  they enhance computational reproducibility.
  For more information on 'FACTS' itself,
  please visit <https://www.berryconsultants.com/software/>.
