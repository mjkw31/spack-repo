class RRserve(RPackage):
	"""Binary R server

	Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets) 
		 which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every
		 connection has a separate workspace and working
		 directory. Client-side implementations are available
		 for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing
		 any application to use facilities of R without the need of
		 linking to R code. Rserve supports remote connection,
		 user authentication and file transfer. A simple R client
		 is included in this package as well.
