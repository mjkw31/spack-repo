class RBetafunctions(RPackage):
	"""Functions for Working with Two- And Four-Parameter Beta
Probability Distributions and Psychometric Analysis of
Classifications

	Package providing a number of functions for working with Two- and 
    Four-parameter Beta and closely related distributions (i.e., the Gamma-
    Binomial-, and Beta-Binomial distributions).
        Includes, among other things: 
    - d/p/q/r functions for Four-Parameter Beta distributions and Generalized
    "Binomial" (continuous) distributions, and d/p/r- functions for Beta-
    Binomial distributions.
    - Moment generating functions for Binomial distributions, Beta-Binomial 
    distributions, and observed value distributions.
    - Functions for estimating classification accuracy and consistency, 
    making use of the Classical Test-Theory based 'Livingston and Lewis' (L&L) 
    and 'Hanson and Brennan' approaches.
      A shiny app is available, providing a GUI for the L&L approach when used 
    for binary classifications. For url to the app, see documentation for the 
    LL.CA() function.
