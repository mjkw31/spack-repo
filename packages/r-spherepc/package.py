	"""Spherical Principal Curves

	Fitting dimension reduction methods to data lying on two-dimensional sphere.
	This package provides principal geodesic analysis, principal circle, principal curves 
	proposed by Hauberg, and spherical principal curves. Moreover, it offers the method of locally   
	defined principal geodesics which is underway. The detailed procedures 
	are described in Lee, J., Kim, J.-H. and Oh, H.-S. (2021) <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3025327>. 
	Also see Kim, J.-H., Lee, J. and Oh, H.-S. (2020) <arXiv:2003.02578>.
