	"""Implementation of the 'Lights Out' Puzzle Game

	Lights Out is a puzzle game consisting of a grid of lights
	that are either on or off. Pressing any light will toggle it and its
	adjacent lights. The goal of the game is to switch all the lights off. This
	package provides an interface to play the game on different board sizes,
	both through the command line or with a visual application. Puzzles can
	also be solved using the automatic solver included. View a demo
	online at <https://daattali.com/shiny/lightsout/>.
