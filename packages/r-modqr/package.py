	"""Multiple-Output Directional Quantile Regression

	Contains basic tools for performing 
  multiple-output quantile regression and computing
  regression quantile contours by means of directional
  regression quantiles. In the location case, one can thus
  obtain halfspace depth contours in two to six dimensions.
