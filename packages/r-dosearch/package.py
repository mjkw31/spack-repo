	"""Causal Effect Identification from Multiple Incomplete Data
Sources

	Identification of causal effects from arbitrary observational and experimental probability distributions via do-calculus and standard probability manipulations using a search-based algorithm by Tikka et al. (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v099.i05>. Allows for the presence of mechanisms related to selection bias (Bareinboim, E. and Tian, J. (2015) <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r445.pdf>), transportability (Bareinboim, E. and Pearl, J. (2014) <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r443.pdf>), missing data (Mohan, K. and Pearl, J. and Tian., J. (2013) <http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r410.pdf>) and arbitrary combinations of these. Also supports identification in the presence of context-specific independence (CSI) relations through labeled directed acyclic graphs (LDAG). For details on CSIs see Corander et al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.apal.2019.04.004>.
