class RGkrls(RPackage):
	"""Generalized Kernel Regularized Least Squares

	Kernel regularized least squares, also known as kernel ridge regression, 
	is a flexible machine learning method. This package implements this method by 
	providing a smooth term for use with 'mgcv' and uses random sketching to 
	facilitate scalable estimation on large datasets. It provides additional 
	functions for calculating marginal effects after estimation and for use with 
	ensembles ('SuperLearning'), double/debiased machine learning ('DoubleML'), 
	and robust/clustered standard errors ('sandwich'). Chang and Goplerud (2023)
	<arXiv:2209.14355> provide further details.
