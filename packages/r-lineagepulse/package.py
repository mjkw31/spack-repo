class RLineagepulse(RPackage):
	"""Differential expression analysis and model fitting for single-cell RNA-seq data

	LineagePulse is a differential expression and expression model fitting package tailored to single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq). LineagePulse accounts for batch effects, drop-out and variable sequencing depth. One can use LineagePulse to perform longitudinal differential expression analysis across pseudotime as a continuous coordinate or between discrete groups of cells (e.g. pre-defined clusters or experimental conditions). Expression model fits can be directly extracted from LineagePulse.
