	"""R Interface to MPI for HPC Clusters (Programming with Big Data
Project)

	A simplified, efficient, interface to MPI for HPC clusters. It is
		a derivation and rethinking of the Rmpi package. pbdMPI embraces the
		prevalent parallel programming style on HPC clusters. Beyond the
		interface, a collection of functions for global work with
		distributed data and resource-independent RNG reproducibility is
		included. It is based on S4 classes and methods.
