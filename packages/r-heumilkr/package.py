	"""Heuristic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem Solver

	Implements the Clarke-Wright algorithm to find a quasi-optimal solution to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. See Clarke, G. and Wright, J.R. (1964) <doi:10.1287/opre.12.4.568> for details. The implementation is accompanied by helper functions to inspect its solution.
