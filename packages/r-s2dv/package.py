class RS2dv(RPackage):
	"""A Set of Common Tools for Seasonal to Decadal Verification

	The advanced version of package 's2dverification'. It is 
	intended for 'seasonal to decadal' (s2d) climate forecast verification, but 
	it can also be used in other kinds of forecasts or general climate analysis.  
	This package is specially designed for the comparison between the experimental 
	and observational datasets. The functionality of the included functions covers 
	from data retrieval, data post-processing, skill scores against observation, 
	to visualization. Compared to 's2dverification', 's2dv' is more compatible 
	with the package 'startR', able to use multiple cores for computation and 
	handle multi-dimensional arrays with a higher flexibility. The CDO version used
	in development is 1.9.8.
