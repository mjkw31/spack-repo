	Variance Stabilized Transformation of Read Counts derived from Bgee RNA-Seq Expression Data. Expression Data includes annotations and is across 6 species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) and across more than 132 tissues. The data is represented as a RData files and is available in ExperimentHub.
