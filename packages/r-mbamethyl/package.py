	"""Model-based analysis of DNA methylation data

	This package provides a function for reconstructing DNA methylation values from raw measurements. It iteratively implements the group fused lars to smooth related-by-location methylation values and the constrained least squares to remove probe affinity effect across multiple sequences.
