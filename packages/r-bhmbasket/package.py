class RBhmbasket(RPackage):
	"""Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Basket Trials

	Provides functions for the evaluation of basket
	trial designs with binary endpoints. Operating characteristics of a
	basket trial design are assessed by simulating trial data according to
	scenarios, analyzing the data with Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs), and
	assessing decision probabilities on stratum and trial-level based on Go / No-go decision making.
	The package is build for high flexibility regarding decision rules,
	number of interim analyses, number of strata, and recruitment.
	The BHMs proposed by
	Berry et al. (2013) <doi:10.1177/1740774513497539>
	and Neuenschwander et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/pst.1730>,
	as well as a model that combines both approaches are implemented.
	Functions are provided to implement Bayesian decision rules as for example
	proposed by Fisch et al. (2015) <doi:10.1177/2168479014533970>.
	In addition, posterior point estimates (mean/median) and credible intervals
	for response rates and some model parameters can be calculated.
	For simulated trial data, bias and mean squared errors of posterior
	point estimates for response rates can be provided.
