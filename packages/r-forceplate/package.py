class RForceplate(RPackage):
	"""Processing Force-Plate Data

	Process raw force-plate data (txt-files) by segmenting them into trials and, if needed, calculating (user-defined) descriptive 
    statistics of variables for user-defined time bins (relative to trigger onsets) for each trial. When segmenting the data a baseline 
    correction, a filter, and a data imputation can be applied if needed. Experimental data can also be processed and combined with the 
    segmented force-plate data. This procedure is suggested by Johannsen et al. (2023) <doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.22190155> and some of the 
    options (e.g., choice of low-pass filter) are also suggested by Winter (2009) <doi:10.1002/9780470549148>.
