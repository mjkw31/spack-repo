	"""Toolbox for WELL Random Number Generators

	It is a dedicated package to WELL pseudo random generators, 
  which were introduced in Panneton et al. (2006), ``Improved Long-Period 
  Generators Based on Linear Recurrences Modulo 2'', see <doi:10.1145/1132973.1132974>. 
  But this package is not intended to be used directly, you are strongly __encouraged__ 
  to use the 'randtoolbox' package, which depends on this package.
