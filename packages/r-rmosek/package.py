class RRmosek(RPackage):
	"""The R to MOSEK Optimization Interface

	This is a meta-package designed to support the
		installation of Rmosek (>= 6.0) and bring the optimization
		facilities of MOSEK (>= 6.0) to the R-language. The interface
		supports large-scale optimization of many kinds: Mixed-integer
		and continuous linear, second-order cone, exponential cone and
		power cone optimization, as well as continuous semidefinite
		optimization. Rmosek and the R-language are open-source
		projects. MOSEK is a proprietary product, but unrestricted
		trial and academic licenses are available.
