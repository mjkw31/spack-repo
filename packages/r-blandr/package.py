class RBlandr(RPackage):
	"""Bland-Altman Method Comparison

	Carries out Bland Altman analyses (also known as a Tukey
	mean-difference plot) as described by JM Bland and DG Altman in
	1986 <doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(86)90837-8>. This package was created in 
	2015 as existing Bland-Altman analysis functions did not calculate 
	confidence intervals. This package was created to rectify this, 
	and create reproducible plots. This package is also available as a module
	for the 'jamovi' statistical spreadsheet (see <https://www.jamovi.org>
	for more information).
