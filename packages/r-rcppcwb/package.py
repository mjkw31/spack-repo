	"""'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'Corpus Workbench' ('CWB')

	'Rcpp' Bindings for the C code of the 'Corpus Workbench' ('CWB'), an indexing and query 
  engine to efficiently analyze large corpora (<https://cwb.sourceforge.io>). 'RcppCWB' is licensed
  under the GNU GPL-3, in line with the GPL-3 license of the 'CWB' (<https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-3>).
  The 'CWB' relies on 'pcre2' (BSD license, see <http://www.pcre.org/licence.txt>)
  and 'GLib' (LGPL license, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html>).
  See the file LICENSE.note for further information. The package includes modified code of the
  'rcqp' package (GPL-2, see <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rcqp>). The original work of the authors
  of the 'rcqp' package is acknowledged with great respect, and they are listed as authors of this
  package. To achieve cross-platform portability (including Windows), using 'Rcpp' for wrapper code
  is the approach used by 'RcppCWB'.
