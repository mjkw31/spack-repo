class RKmblock(RPackage):
	"""k-Means Like Blockmodeling of One-Mode and Linked Networks

	Implements k-means like blockmodeling of one-mode and linked networks as presented in Å½iberna (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.006>. The development of this package is financially supported by the Slovenian Research Agency (<https://www.arrs.si/>) within the research programs P5-0168 and the research projects J7-8279 (Blockmodeling multilevel and temporal networks) and J5-2557 (Comparison and evaluation of different approaches to blockmodeling dynamic networks by simulations with application to Slovenian co-authorship networks).
