class RScoringtools(RPackage):
	"""Credit Scoring Tools

	Grouping essential tools for credit scoring. These statistical tools may be useful for other use-cases as well but were primarily designed for it. First, there are Reject Inference methods (Ehrhardt et al. (2017) <arXiv:1903.10855>). Second, we build upon the already CRAN-available package 'discretization' to automate discretization of continuous features.
