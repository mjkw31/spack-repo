	"""MOGAMUN: A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to Find Active Modules in Multiplex Biological Networks

	MOGAMUN is a multi-objective genetic algorithm that identifies active modules in a multiplex biological network. This allows analyzing different biological networks at the same time. MOGAMUN is based on NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, version II), which we adapted to work on networks.
