class RClock(RPackage):
	"""Date-Time Types and Tools.

	Provides a comprehensive library for date-time manipulations using a new
	family of orthogonal date-time classes (durations, time points,
	zoned-times, and calendars) that partition responsibilities so that the
	complexities of time zones are only considered when they are really needed.
	Capabilities include: date-time parsing, formatting, arithmetic, extraction
	and updating of components, and rounding."""
