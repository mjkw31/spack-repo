	"""Track Machine Learning Experiments

	'Guild AI' is an open-source tool for managing machine learning
	experiments. It's for scientists, engineers, and researchers who want to
	run scripts, compare results, measure progress, and automate machine
	learning workflow. 'Guild AI' is a light weight, external tool that runs
	locally. It works with any framework, doesn't require any changes to
	your code, or access to any web services. Users can easily record
	experiment metadata, track model changes, manage experiment artifacts,
	tune hyperparameters, and share results. 'Guild AI' combines features
	from 'Git', 'SQLite', and 'Make' to provide a lab notebook for machine
	learning.
