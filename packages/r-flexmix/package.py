	"""Flexible Mixture Modeling.

	A general framework for finite mixtures of regression models using the EM
	algorithm is implemented. The E-step and all data handling are provided,
	while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new models.
	Existing drivers implement mixtures of standard linear models, generalized
	linear models and model-based clustering."""
