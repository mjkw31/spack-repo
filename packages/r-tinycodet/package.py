class RTinycodet(RPackage):
	"""Functions to Help in your Coding Etiquette

	Adds some functions to help in your coding etiquette.
    'tinycodet' primarily focuses on 4 aspects.
    1) Safer decimal (in)equality testing, safer atomic conversions, and other functions for safer coding.
    2) A new package import system,
    that attempts to combine the benefits of using a package without attaching it,
    with the benefits of attaching a package.
    3) Extending the string manipulation capabilities of the 'stringi' R package.
    4) Reducing repetitive code.
    Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'tinycodet' has only one other dependency, namely 'stringi'.
