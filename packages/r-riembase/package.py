	"""Functions and C++ Header Files for Computation on Manifolds

	We provide a number of algorithms to estimate fundamental statistics including Fr√©chet mean and geometric median for manifold-valued data. Also, C++ header files are contained that implement elementary operations on manifolds such as Sphere, Grassmann, and others. See Bhattacharya and Bhattacharya (2012) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139094764> if you are interested in statistics on manifolds, and Absil et al (2007, ISBN:9780691132983) on computational aspects of optimization on matrix manifolds.
