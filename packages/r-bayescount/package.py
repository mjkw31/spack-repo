class RBayescount(RPackage):
	"""Power Calculations and Bayesian Analysis of Count Distributions
and FECRT Data using MCMC

	A set of functions to allow analysis of count data (such
		as faecal egg count data) using Bayesian MCMC methods.  Returns
		information on the possible values for mean count, coefficient
		of variation and zero inflation (true prevalence) present in
		the data.  A complete faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT)
		model is implemented, which returns inference on the true
		efficacy of the drug from the pre- and post-treatment data
		provided, using non-parametric bootstrapping as well as using
		Bayesian MCMC.  Functions to perform power analyses for faecal
		egg counts (including FECRT) are also provided.
