class RPopvar(RPackage):
	"""Genomic Breeding Tools: Genetic Variance Prediction and
	Cross-Validation.

	The main attribute of 'PopVar' is the prediction of genetic variance in
	bi-parental populations,  from which the package derives its name. 'PopVar'
	contains a set of functions that use phenotypic and genotypic data from a
	set of candidate parents to 1) predict the mean, genetic variance, and
	superior progeny value of all,  or a defined set of pairwise bi-parental
	crosses, and 2) perform cross-validation to estimate genome-wide prediction
	accuracy of multiple statistical models. More details are available in
	Mohammadi, Tiede, and Smith (2015, <doi:10.2135/cropsci2015.01.0030>).  A
	dataset 'think_barley.rda' is included for reference and examples."""
