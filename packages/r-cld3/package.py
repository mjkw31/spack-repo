	"""Google's Compact Language Detector 3

	Google's Compact Language Detector 3 is a neural network model for language 
	identification and the successor of 'cld2' (available from CRAN). The algorithm is still
	experimental and takes a novel approach to language detection with different properties
	and outcomes. It can be useful to combine this with the Bayesian classifier results 
	from 'cld2'. See <https://github.com/google/cld3#readme> for more information.
