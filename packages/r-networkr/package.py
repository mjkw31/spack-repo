	"""Network Analysis and Visualization

	Collection of functions for fast manipulation, handling, and analysis of large-scale
	networks based on family and social data. Functions are utility functions used to manipulate data
	in three "formats": sparse adjacency matrices, pedigree trio family data, and pedigree family data.
	When possible, the functions should be able to handle millions of data points quickly for use in combination
	with data from large public national registers and databases.
