class RAirgrteaching(RPackage):
	"""Teaching Hydrological Modelling with the GR Rainfall-Runoff
Models ('Shiny' Interface Included)

	Add-on package to the 'airGR' package that simplifies its use and is aimed at being used for teaching hydrology. The package provides 1) three functions that allow to complete very simply a hydrological modelling exercise 2) plotting functions to help students to explore observed data and to interpret the results of calibration and simulation of the GR ('GÃ©nie rural') models 3) a 'Shiny' graphical interface that allows for displaying the impact of model parameters on hydrographs and models internal variables.
