	"""Fast Imputations Using 'Rcpp' and 'Armadillo'

	
  Fast imputations under the object-oriented programming paradigm. 	
  Moreover there are offered a few functions built to work with popular R packages such as 'data.table' or 'dplyr'.
  The biggest improvement in time performance could be achieve for a calculation where a grouping variable have to be used.
  A single evaluation of a quantitative model for the multiple imputations is another major enhancement.
  A new major improvement is one of the fastest predictive mean matching in the R world because of presorting and binary search.
