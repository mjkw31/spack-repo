class RBiggp(RPackage):
	"""Distributed Gaussian Process Calculations

	Distributes Gaussian process calculations across nodes
	in a distributed memory setting, using Rmpi. The bigGP class 
	provides high-level methods for maximum likelihood with normal data, 
	prediction, calculation of uncertainty (i.e., posterior covariance 
	calculations), and simulation of realizations. In addition, bigGP 
	provides an API for basic matrix calculations with distributed 
	covariance matrices, including Cholesky decomposition, back/forwardsolve, 
	crossproduct, and matrix multiplication.
