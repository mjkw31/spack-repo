	"""Multiple Testing Procedures with Adaptation for Discrete Tests

	Multiple testing procedures described in the paper DÃ¶hler, Durand and Roquain (2018) "New FDR bounds for discrete and heterogeneous tests" <doi:10.1214/18-EJS1441>. The main procedures of the paper (HSU and HSD), their adaptive counterparts (AHSU and AHSD), and the HBR variant are available and are coded to take as input a set of observed p-values and their discrete support under the null. A function to compute such p-values and supports for Fisher's exact tests is also provided, along with a wrapper allowing to apply discrete procedures directly from contingency tables.
