	"""A Curated Microarrays Dataset of MDI-induced Differentiated Adipocytes (3T3-L1) Under Genetic and Pharmacological Perturbations

	A curated dataset of Microarrays samples. The samples are MDI- induced pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1) at different time points/stage of differentiation under different types of genetic (knockdown/overexpression) and pharmacological (drug treatment) perturbations. The package documents the data collection and processing. In addition to the documentation, the package contains the scripts that was used to generated the data.
