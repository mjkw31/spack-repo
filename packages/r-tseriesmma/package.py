	"""Multiscale Multifractal Analysis of Time Series Data

	Multiscale multifractal analysis (MMA) (Giera≈Çtowski et al.,
    2012)<DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.85.021915> is a time series analysis method,
    designed to describe scaling properties of fluctuations within the signal
    analyzed. The main result of this procedure is the so called Hurst surface
    h(q,s) , which is a dependence of the local Hurst exponent h (fluctuation
    scaling exponent) on the multifractal parameter q and the scale of observation s
    (data window width).
