class RCrc32c(RPackage):
	"""Cyclic Redundancy Check with CPU-Specific Acceleration

	Hardware-based support for 'CRC32C' cyclic redundancy checksum function
  is made available for 'x86_64' systems with 'SSE2' support as well as for 'arm64', 
  and detected at build-time via 'cmake' with a software-based fallback.  This
  functionality is exported at the 'C'-language level for use by other packages.
  'CRC32C' is described in 'RFC 3270' at <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3720>
  and is based on 'Castagnoli et al' <doi:10.1109/26.231911>.
