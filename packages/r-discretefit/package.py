class RDiscretefit(RPackage):
	"""Simulated Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Discrete Distributions

	Implements fast Monte Carlo simulations for 
	goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests for discrete distributions. This 
	includes tests based on the Chi-squared statistic, the 
	log-likelihood-ratio (G^2) statistic, the Freeman-Tukey 
	(Hellinger-distance) statistic, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
	statistic, the Cramer-von Mises statistic as described in 
	Choulakian, Lockhart and Stephens (1994) <doi:10.2307/3315828>, 
	and the root-mean-square statistic, see Perkins, 
	Tygert, and Ward (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.amc.2011.03.124>.
