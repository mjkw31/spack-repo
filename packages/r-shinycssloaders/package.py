	"""Add Loading Animations to a 'shiny' Output While It's
Recalculating

	When a 'Shiny' output (such as a plot, table, map, etc.) is recalculating, it remains 
    visible but gets greyed out. Using 'shinycssloaders', you can add a loading animation ("spinner")
    to outputs instead. By wrapping a 'Shiny' output in 'withSpinner()', a spinner will automatically
    appear while the output is recalculating. See the demo online at
    <https://daattali.com/shiny/shinycssloaders-demo/>.
