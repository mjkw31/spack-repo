class RRbowtie(RPackage):
	"""R bowtie wrapper

	This package provides an R wrapper around the popular bowtie short read aligner and around SpliceMap, a de novo splice junction discovery and alignment tool. The package is used by the QuasR bioconductor package. We recommend to use the QuasR package instead of using Rbowtie directly.
