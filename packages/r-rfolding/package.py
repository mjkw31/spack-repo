	"""The Folding Test of Unimodality

	The basic algorithm to perform the folding test of unimodality. 
  Given a dataset X (d dimensional, n samples), the test checks whether the 
  distribution of the data are rather unimodal or rather multimodal. This 
  package stems from the following research publication: 
  Siffer Alban, Pierre-Alain Fouque, Alexandre Termier, and Christine LargouÃ«t. 
  "Are your data gathered?" In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International 
  Conference on Knowledge Discovery Data Mining, pp. 2210-2218. ACM, 2018.
