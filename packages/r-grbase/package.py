class RGrbase(RPackage):
	"""A Package for Graphical Modelling in R.

	The 'gRbase' package provides graphical modelling features used by e.g. the
	packages 'gRain', 'gRim' and 'gRc'. 'gRbase' implements graph algorithms
	including (i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked graphs).
	(ii) moralization, (iii) triangulation, (iv) creation of junction tree.
	'gRbase' facilitates array operations, 'gRbase' implements functions for
	testing for conditional independence. 'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical
	log-linear models may be implemented and describes concept of graphical
	meta data.  The facilities of the package are documented in the book by
	Hojsgaard, Edwards and Lauritzen (2012, <doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-2299-0>)
	and in the paper by  Dethlefsen and Hojsgaard, (2005,
	<doi:10.18637/jss.v014.i17>).  Please see 'citation("gRbase")' for citation
	details.  NOTICE  'gRbase' requires that the packages graph, 'Rgraphviz'
	and 'RBGL' are installed from 'bioconductor'; for installation instructions
	please refer to the web page given below."""
