	"""Collaborative Editing of Rmd (or Rnw) Documents in Google Drive

	Collaborative writing and editing of R Markdown (or Sweave) documents. The local .Rmd (or .Rnw) is uploaded as a plain-text file to Google Drive. By taking advantage of the easily readable Markdown (or LaTeX) syntax and the well-known online interface offered by Google Docs, collaborators can easily contribute to the writing and editing process. After integrating all authorsâ€™ contributions, the final document can be downloaded and rendered locally.
