class RRbioapi(RPackage):
	"""User-Friendly R Interface to Biologic Web Services' API

	Currently fully supports Enrichr, JASPAR, miEAA, PANTHER,
    Reactome, STRING, and UniProt! The goal of rbioapi is to provide a
    user-friendly and consistent interface to biological databases and
    services. In a way that insulates the user from the technicalities of
    using web services API and creates a unified and easy-to-use interface
    to biological and medical web services. This is an ongoing project; New
    databases and services will be added periodically. Feel free to
    suggest any databases or services you often use.
