class RDynr(RPackage):
	"""Dynamic Models with Regime-Switching

	Intensive longitudinal data have become increasingly prevalent in
	various scientific disciplines. Many such data sets are noisy, multivariate,
	and multi-subject in nature. The change functions may also be continuous,
	or continuous but interspersed with periods of discontinuities (i.e.,
	showing regime switches). The package 'dynr' (Dynamic Modeling in R) is an
	R package that implements a set of computationally efficient algorithms for
	handling a broad class of linear and nonlinear discrete- and continuous-time
	models with regime-switching properties under the constraint of linear
	Gaussian measurement functions. The discrete-time models can generally
	take on the form of a state-space or difference equation model. The
	continuous-time models are generally expressed as a set of ordinary or
	stochastic differential equations. All estimation and computations are
	performed in C, but users are provided with the option to specify the
	model of interest via a set of simple and easy-to-learn model specification
	functions in R. Model fitting can be performed using single-subject time
	series data or multiple-subject longitudinal data. Ou, Hunter, & Chow
	(2019) <doi:10.32614%2FRJ-2019-012> provided a detailed introduction to the
	interface and more information on the algorithms.
