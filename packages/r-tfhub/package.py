	"""Interface to 'TensorFlow' Hub

	'TensorFlow' Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and
	consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a 
	self-contained piece of a 'TensorFlow' graph, along with its weights and 
	assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as
	transfer learning. Transfer learning train a model with a smaller dataset,
	improve generalization, and speed up training.
