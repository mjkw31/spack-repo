	"""Some Distributions from the 'Boost' Library and More

	Make some distributions from the 'C++' library 'Boost'
	available in 'R'. In addition, the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution
	and the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution are provided. The 
	distributions are represented by 'R6' classes. The method to sample from 
	the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution is the one given in 
	"Random variate generation for the generalized inverse Gaussian 
	distribution" Luc Devroye (2012) <doi:10.1007/s11222-012-9367-z>.
