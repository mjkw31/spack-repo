class RPanelmatch(RPackage):
	"""Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series
Cross-Sectional Data

	Implements a set of methodological tools
		 that enable researchers to apply matching methods to
		 time-series cross-sectional data. Imai, Kim, and Wang
		 (2021) <http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/tscs.pdf> 
		 proposes a nonparametric generalization of the
		 difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
		 on the linearity assumption as often done in
		 practice. Researchers first select a method of matching
		 each treated observation for a given unit in a
		 particular time period with control observations from
		 other units in the same time period that have a similar
		 treatment and covariate history. These methods include
		 standard matching methods based on propensity score and
		 Mahalanobis distance, as well as weighting methods. Once 
		 matching is done, both short-term and long-term average 
		 treatment effects for the treated can be estimated with 
		 standard errors. The package also offers a visualization 
		 technique that allows researchers to assess the quality 
		 of matches by examining the resulting covariate balance.
