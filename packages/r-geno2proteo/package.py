	"""Finding the DNA and Protein Sequences of Any Genomic or
Proteomic Loci

	Using the DNA sequence and gene annotation files provided in 
			'ENSEMBL' <https://www.ensembl.org/index.html>, 
			the functions implemented in the package try to find the DNA sequences and 
			protein sequences of any given genomic loci, and to find the genomic coordinates 
			and protein sequences of any given protein locations, which are the frequent
			tasks in the analysis of genomic and proteomic data.
