	"""Functional Rarity Indices Computation

	Computes functional rarity indices as proposed by Violle et al.
    (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2017.02.002>. Various indices can be computed
    using both regional and local information. Functional Rarity combines both
    the functional aspect of rarity as well as the extent aspect of rarity.
    'funrar' is presented in Greni√© et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/ddi.12629>.
