	"""Mixed Multivariate Cumulative Incidence Functions

	Fits the mixed cumulative incidence functions model suggested by 
	<doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx072> which decomposes within cluster 
	dependence of risk and timing. The estimation method supports computation in 
	parallel using a shared memory C++ implementation. A sandwich estimator of the 
	covariance matrix is available. Natural cubic splines are used to provide a 
	flexible model for the cumulative incidence functions.
