	"""Vaccine Phase I Design with Simultaneous Evaluation of
Immunogenicity and Toxicity

	
	Phase I clinical trials are the first step in drug development to test
	a new drug or drug combination on humans. Typical designs of Phase I 
	trials use toxicity as the primary endpoint and aim to find the maximum 
	tolerable dosage. However, these designs are poorly applicable for the 
	development of cancer therapeutic vaccines because the expected safety 
	concerns for these vaccines are not as much as cytotoxic agents. The 
	primary objectives of a cancer therapeutic vaccine phase I trial thus 
	often include determining whether the vaccine shows biologic activity 
	and the minimum dose necessary to achieve a full immune or even clinical 
	response. This package implements a Bayesian Phase I cancer vaccine
	trial design that allows simultaneous evaluation of safety and
	immunogenicity outcomes. See Wang et al. (2019) <DOI:10.1002/sim.8021>
	for further details.
