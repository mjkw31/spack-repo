	"""Controlling bias and inflation in association studies using the empirical null distribution

	Bacon can be used to remove inflation and bias often observed in epigenome- and transcriptome-wide association studies. To this end bacon constructs an empirical null distribution using a Gibbs Sampling algorithm by fitting a three-component normal mixture on z-scores.
