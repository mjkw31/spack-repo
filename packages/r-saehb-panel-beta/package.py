class RSaehbPanelBeta(RPackage):
	"""Small Area Estimation using HB for Rao Yu Model under Beta
Distribution

	Several functions are provided for small area estimation at
	the area level using the hierarchical bayesian (HB) method with panel
	data under beta distribution for variable interest. This package also
	provides a dataset produced by data generation. The 'rjags' package is
	employed to obtain parameter estimates. Model-based estimators involve
	the HB estimators, which include the mean and the variation of the
	mean. For the reference, see Rao and Molina (2015, ISBN:
	978-1-118-73578-7).
