	"""Identifying Genes Overexpressed in Subsets of Tumors from Tumor-Normal mRNA Expression Data

	This package helps identify mRNAs that are overexpressed in subsets of tumors relative to normal tissue. Ideal inputs would be paired tumor-normal data from the same tissue from many patients (>15 pairs). This unsupervised approach relies on the observation that oncogenes are characteristically overexpressed in only a subset of tumors in the population, and may help identify oncogene candidates purely based on differences in mRNA expression between previously unknown subtypes.
