class RGbp(RPackage):
	"""A Bin Packing Problem Solver

	Basic infrastructure and several algorithms for 1d-4d bin packing
	problem. This package provides a set of c-level classes and solvers for
	1d-4d bin packing problem, and an r-level solver for 4d bin packing problem,
	which is a wrapper over the c-level 4d bin packing problem solver.
	The 4d bin packing problem solver aims to solve bin packing problem, a.k.a
	container loading problem, with an additional constraint on weight.
	Given a set of rectangular-shaped items, and a set of rectangular-shaped bins
	with weight limit, the solver looks for an orthogonal packing solution
	such that minimizes the number of bins and maximize volume utilization.
	Each rectangular-shaped item i = 1, .. , n is characterized by length l_i,
	depth d_i, height h_i, and weight w_i, and each rectangular-shaped bin
	j = 1, .. , m is specified similarly by length l_j, depth d_j, height h_j,
	and weight limit w_j.
	The item can be rotated into any orthogonal direction, and no further
	restrictions implied.
