class RInterpolation(RPackage):
	"""Interpolation of Bivariate Functions

	Provides two different methods, linear and nonlinear, to
	interpolate a bivariate function, scalar-valued or vector-valued. 
	The interpolated data are not necessarily gridded. The algorithms 
	are performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL' (<https://www.cgal.org/>).
