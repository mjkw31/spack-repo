class RWeightedtreemaps(RPackage):
	"""Generate and Plot Voronoi or Sunburst Treemaps from Hierarchical
Data

	Treemaps are a visually appealing graphical representation of
	numerical data using a space-filling approach. A plane or 'map' is
	subdivided into smaller areas called cells.  The cells in the map are
	scaled according to an underlying metric which allows to grasp the
	hierarchical organization and relative importance of many objects at
	once. This package contains two different implementations of treemaps,
	Voronoi treemaps and Sunburst treemaps.  The Voronoi treemap function
	subdivides the plot area in polygonal cells according to the highest
	hierarchical level, then continues to subdivide those parental cells
	on the next lower hierarchical level, and so on. The Sunburst treemap
	is a computationally less demanding treemap that does not require
	iterative refinement, but simply generates circle sectors that are
	sized according to predefined weights.  The Voronoi tesselation is
	based on functions from Paul Murrell (2012)
