	"""An Accurate kNN Implementation with Multiple Distance Measures

	
	Similarly to the 'FNN' package, this package allows calculation of the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of a data matrix.
	The implementation is based on cover trees introduced by
	Alina Beygelzimer, Sham Kakade, and John Langford (2006) <doi:10.1145/1143844.1143857>.
