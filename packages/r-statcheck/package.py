class RStatcheck(RPackage):
	"""Extract Statistics from Articles and Recompute P-Values

	A "spellchecker" for statistics. It checks whether your p-values match their accompanying test statistic and 
  degrees of freedom. statcheck searches for null-hypothesis significance test 
  (NHST) in APA style (e.g., t(28) = 2.2, p < .05). It recalculates the p-value 
  using the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. If the reported and 
  computed p-values don't match, statcheck will flag the result as an error. If
  the reported p-value is statistically significant and the recomputed one is not,
  or vice versa, the result will be flagged as a decision error. 
  You can use statcheck directly on a string of text, but you can also scan a PDF 
  or HTML file, or even a folder of PDF and/or HTML files. 
  Statcheck needs an external program to convert PDF to text: Xpdf. Instructions
  on where and how to download this program, how to install statcheck, and more
  details on what statcheck can and cannot do can be found in the online manual: 
  <https://rpubs.com/michelenuijten/statcheckmanual>. 
  You can find a point-and-click web interface to scan PDF or HTML or DOCX 
  articles on <http://statcheck.io>.
