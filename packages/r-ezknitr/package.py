	"""Avoid the Typical Working Directory Pain When Using 'knitr'

	An extension of 'knitr' that adds flexibility in several
	ways. One common source of frustration with 'knitr' is that it assumes
	the directory where the source file lives should be the working directory,
	which is often not true. 'ezknitr' addresses this problem by giving you
	complete control over where all the inputs and outputs are, and adds several
	other convenient features to make rendering markdown/HTML documents easier.
