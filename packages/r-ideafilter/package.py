class RIdeafilter(RPackage):
	"""Agnostic, Idiomatic Data Filter Module for Shiny

	When added to an existing shiny app, users may subset any
    developer-chosen R data.frame on the fly. That is, users are empowered to
    slice & dice data by applying multiple (order specific) filters using the
    AND (&) operator between each, and getting real-time updates on the number
    of rows effected/available along the way. Thus, any downstream processes
    that leverage this data source (like tables, plots, or statistical procedures)
    will re-render after new filters are applied. The shiny moduleâ€™s user interface has
    a 'minimalist' aesthetic so that the focus can be on the data &
    other visuals. In addition to returning a reactive (filtered) data.frame,
    'IDEAFilter' as also returns 'dplyr' filter statements used to actually slice
    the data.
