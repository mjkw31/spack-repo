class RFcl(RPackage):
	"""A Financial Calculator

	A financial calculator that provides very fast implementations
	of common financial indicators using 'Rust' code. It includes functions for
	bond-related indicators, such as yield to maturity ('YTM'), modified duration,
	and Macaulay duration, as well as functions for calculating time-weighted
	and money-weighted rates of return (using 'Modified Dietz' method) for multiple portfolios,
	given their market values and profit and loss ('PnL') data. 'fcl' is designed
	to be efficient and accurate for financial analysis and computation. The methods
	used in this package are based on the following references:
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Dietz_method>,
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_return>.
