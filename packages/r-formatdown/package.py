class RFormatdown(RPackage):
	"""Formatting Tools for 'rmarkdown' Documents

	Provides a small set of tools for formatting tasks when creating 
    documents in R Markdown or Quarto Markdown. Convert the elements of a 
    numerical vector to character strings in one of several forms: powers-of-ten 
    notation in engineering or scientific form delimited for rendering as inline 
    equations; integer or decimal notation delimited for equation rendering; 
    numbers with measurement units (non-delimited) where units are selected to 
    eliminate the need for powers-of-ten or scientific notation. Useful for 
    rendering a numerical scalar in an inline R code chunk as well as formatting 
    columns of data frames displayed in a table.
