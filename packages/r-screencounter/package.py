class RScreencounter(RPackage):
	"""Counting Reads in High-Throughput Sequencing Screens

	Provides functions for counting reads from high-throughput sequencing screen data (e.g., CRISPR, shRNA) to quantify barcode abundance. Currently supports single barcodes in single- or paired-end data, and combinatorial barcodes in paired-end data.
