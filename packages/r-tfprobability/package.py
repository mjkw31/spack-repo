class RTfprobability(RPackage):
	"""Interface to 'TensorFlow Probability'

	Interface to 'TensorFlow Probability', a 'Python' library built on 'TensorFlow'
	that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware ('TPU', 'GPU').
	'TensorFlow Probability' includes a wide selection of probability distributions and bijectors, probabilistic layers,
	variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, BFGS, and SGLD.
