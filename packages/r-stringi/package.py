	"""Character String Processing Facilities.

	A multitude of character string/text/natural language processing tools:
	pattern searching (e.g., with 'Java'-like regular expressions or the
	'Unicode' collation algorithm), random string generation, case mapping,
	string transliteration, concatenation, sorting, padding, wrapping, Unicode
	normalisation, date-time formatting and parsing, and many more.  They are
	fast, consistent, convenient, and - owing to the use of the 'ICU'
	(International Components for Unicode) library - portable across all
	locales and platforms."""
