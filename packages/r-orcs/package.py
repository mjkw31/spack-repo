	"""Omnidirectional R Code Snippets

	I tend to repeat the same code chunks over and over again. At
	first, this was fine for me and I paid little attention to such redundancies.
	A little later, when I got tired of manually replacing Linux filepaths with
	the referring Windows versions, and vice versa, I started to stuff some very
	frequently used work-steps into functions and, even later, into a proper R
	package. And that's what this package is - a hodgepodge of various R functions
	meant to simplify (my) everyday-life coding work without, at the same time,
	being devoted to a particular scope of application.
