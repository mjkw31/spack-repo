	"""The IsoSpec Algorithm

	IsoSpec is a fine structure calculator used for obtaining the most
	probable masses of a chemical compound given the frequencies of the composing
	isotopes and their masses. It finds the smallest set of isotopologues with
	a given probability. The probability is assumed to be that of the product of
	multinomial distributions, each corresponding to one particular element and
	parametrized by the frequencies of finding these elements in nature. These
	numbers are supplied by IUPAC - the International Union of Pure and Applied
	Chemistry. See: Lacki, Valkenborg, Startek (2020) <DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00959>
	and Lacki, Startek, Valkenborg, Gambin (2017) <DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01459>
	for the description of the algorithms used.
