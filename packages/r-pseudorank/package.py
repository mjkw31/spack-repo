	"""Pseudo-Ranks

	Efficient calculation of pseudo-ranks and (pseudo)-rank based test statistics. In case of equal sample sizes, pseudo-ranks and mid-ranks are equal. When used for inference mid-ranks may lead to paradoxical results. Pseudo-ranks are in general not affected by such a problem <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.c01>.
