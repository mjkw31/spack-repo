class RResidualmatrix(RPackage):
	"""Creating a DelayedMatrix of Regression Residuals

	Provides delayed computation of a matrix of residuals after fitting a linear model to each column of an input matrix. Also supports partial computation of residuals where selected factors are to be preserved in the output matrix. Implements a number of efficient methods for operating on the delayed matrix of residuals, most notably matrix multiplication and calculation of row/column sums or means.
