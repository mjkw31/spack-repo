class RPedometrics(RPackage):
	"""Miscellaneous Pedometric Tools

	An R implementation of methods employed in the field of pedometrics, soil science
	discipline dedicated to studying the spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal variation of soil
	using statistical and computational methods. The methods found here include the calibration of
	linear regression models using covariate selection strategies, computation of summary validation
	statistics for predictions, generation of summary plots, evaluation of the local quality of a
	geostatistical model of uncertainty, and so on. Other functions simply extend the
	functionalities of or facilitate the usage of functions from other packages that are commonly
	used for the analysis of soil data. Formerly available versions of suggested packages no longer
	available from CRAN can be obtained from the CRAN archive
	<https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/>.
