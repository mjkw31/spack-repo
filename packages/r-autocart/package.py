	"""Autocorrelation Regression Trees

	A modified version of the classification and regression tree (CART) 
	algorithm for modelling spatial data that features coordinate information.
	Coordinate information can be used to evaluate measures of spatial
	autocorrelation and spatial compactness during the splitting phase of the
	tree, leading to better predictions and more physically realistic predictions
	on these types of datasets. These methods are described in Ancell and Bean (2021)
	<arXiv:2101.08258>.
