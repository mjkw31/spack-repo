class RGpboost(RPackage):
	"""Combining Tree-Boosting with Gaussian Process and Mixed Effects
Models

	An R package that allows for combining tree-boosting with Gaussian process and mixed effects models. It also allows for independently doing tree-boosting as well as inference and prediction for Gaussian process and mixed effects models. See <https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost> for more information on the software and Sigrist (2022, JMLR) <https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/20-322.html> and Sigrist (2023, TPAMI) <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3168152> for more information on the methodology.
