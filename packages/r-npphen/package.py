class RNpphen(RPackage):
	"""Vegetation Phenological Cycle and Anomaly Detection using Remote
Sensing Data

	Calculates phenological cycle and anomalies using a non-parametric
    approach applied to time series of vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data 
    or field measurements. The package implements basic and high-level functions for 
    manipulating vector data (numerical series) and raster data (satellite derived products).
    Processing of very large raster files is supported. For more information, please check 
    the following paper:
    Ch√°vez et al. (2023) <doi:10.3390/rs15010073>.
