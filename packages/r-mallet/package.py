class RMallet(RPackage):
	"""An R Wrapper for the Java Mallet Topic Modeling Toolkit

	
  An R interface for the Java Machine Learning for Language Toolkit (mallet)
  <http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/> to estimate probabilistic topic models, such
  as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We can use the R package to read textual 
  data into mallet from R objects, run the Java implementation of mallet 
  directly in R, and extract results as R objects. The Mallet toolkit 
  has many functions, this wrapper focuses on the topic modeling sub-package 
  written by David Mimno. The package uses the rJava package to connect to a 
  JVM.
