class RRehydrator(RPackage):
	"""Downloads Tweets from a List of Tweet IDs

	Facilitates replication of Twitter-based research by handling
    common programming tasks needed when downloading tweets.  Specifically, it ensures a 
    user does not exceed Twitterâ€™s rate limits, and it saves tweets in moderately sized files.  
    While a user could perform these tasks in their own code, doing so may be beyond the 
    capabilities of many users.
