class RSiminf(RPackage):
	"""A Framework for Data-Driven Stochastic Disease Spread
Simulations

	Provides an efficient and very flexible framework to
	conduct data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large
	scale disease spread simulations. The framework integrates
	infection dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov
	chains using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and
	incorporates available data such as births, deaths and movements
	as scheduled events at predefined time-points. Using C code for
	the numerical solvers and 'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work
	over multiple processors ensures high performance when simulating
	a sample outcome. One of our design goals was to make the package
	extendable and enable usage of the numerical solvers from other R
	extension packages in order to facilitate complex epidemiological
	research. The package contains template models and can be extended
	with user-defined models. For more details see the paper by
	Widgren, Bauer, Eriksson and Engblom (2019)
	<doi:10.18637/jss.v091.i12>. The package also provides
	functionality to fit models to time series data using the
	Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo
	('ABC-SMC') algorithm of Toni and others (2009)
	<doi:10.1098/rsif.2008.0172>.
