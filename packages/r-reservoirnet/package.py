class RReservoirnet(RPackage):
	"""Reservoir Computing and Echo State Networks

	A simple user-friendly library based on the 'python' module 'reservoirpy'.
			 It provides a flexible interface to implement efficient Reservoir
			 Computing (RC) architectures with a particular focus on Echo State Networks
			 (ESN). Some of its features are: offline and online training, parallel implementation, 
			 sparse matrix computation, fast spectral initialization, advanced learning 
			 rules (e.g. Intrinsic Plasticity) etc. It also makes possible to easily create 
			 complex architectures with multiple reservoirs (e.g. deep reservoirs), readouts, 
			 and complex feedback loops. Moreover, graphical tools are included to easily 
			 explore hyperparameters. Finally, it includes several tutorials exploring
			 time series forecasting, classification and hyperparameter tuning. For more information
			 about 'reservoirpy', please see Trouvain et al. (2020) <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-61616-8_40>.
			 This package was developed in the framework of the University of Bordeauxâ€™s IdEx
			 "Investments for the Future" program / RRI PHDS.
