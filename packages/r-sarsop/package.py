	"""Approximate POMDP Planning Software

	A toolkit for Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). Provides
	bindings to C++ libraries implementing the algorithm SARSOP (Successive Approximations
	of the Reachable Space under Optimal Policies) and described in Kurniawati et al (2008),
	<doi:10.15607/RSS.2008.IV.009>.  This package also provides a high-level interface
	for generating, solving and simulating POMDP problems and their solutions.
