	"""Symbolic Computation for Structural Equation Models

	A collection of functions for symbolic computation using the
			 'caracas' package for structural equation models and other
			 statistical analyses. Among its features is the ability
			 to calculate the model-implied covariance (and correlation)
			 matrix and the sampling covariance matrix of variable functions
			 using the delta method.
