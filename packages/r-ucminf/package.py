class RUcminf(RPackage):
	"""General-Purpose Unconstrained Non-Linear Optimization.

	An algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization.
	The algorithm is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS updating of the inverse
	Hessian and soft line search with a trust region type monitoring of the
	input to the line search algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is designed
	for easy interchange with 'optim'."""
