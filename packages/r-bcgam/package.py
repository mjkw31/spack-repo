class RBcgam(RPackage):
	"""Bayesian Constrained Generalised Linear Models

	Fits generalised partial linear regression models using a Bayesian approach, where shape and
			smoothness constraints are imposed on nonparametrically modelled predictors through shape-restricted splines, and 
			no constraints are imposed on optional parametrically modelled covariates. See Meyer et al. (2011) <doi/10.1080/10485252.2011.597852> 
			for more details. IMPORTANT: before installing 'bcgam', you need to install 'Rtools' (Windows) or 'Xcode' (Mac OS X). These are	
			required for the correct installation of 'nimble' (<https://r-nimble.org/download>).
