	"""Multiple-Instance Logistic Regression with LASSO Penalty

	The multiple instance data set consists of many independent
	subjects (called bags) and each subject is composed of several components
	(called instances). The outcomes of such data set are binary or categorical responses,
	and, we can only observe the subject-level outcomes. For example, in manufacturing
	processes, a subject is labeled as "defective" if at least one of its own
	components is defective, and otherwise, is labeled as "non-defective". The
	'milr' package focuses on the predictive model for the multiple instance
	data set with binary outcomes and performs the maximum likelihood estimation
	with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm under the framework of logistic
	regression. Moreover, the LASSO penalty is attached to the likelihood function
	for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection.
