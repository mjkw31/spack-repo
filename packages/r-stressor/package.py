class RStressor(RPackage):
	"""Algorithms for Testing Models under Stress

	Traditional model evaluation metrics fail to capture model 
	performance under less than ideal conditions. This package employs 
	techniques to evaluate models "under-stress". This includes testing 
	models' extrapolation ability, or testing accuracy on specific 
	sub-samples of the overall model space. Details describing stress-testing 
	methods in this package are provided in 
	Haycock (2023) <doi:10.26076/2am5-9f67>. The other primary contribution of 
	this package is provided to R users access to the 'Python' library 'PyCaret'
	<https://pycaret.org/> for quick and easy access to auto-tuned 
	machine learning models.
