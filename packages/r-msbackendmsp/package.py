	"""Mass Spectrometry Data Backend for NIST msp Files

	Mass spectrometry (MS) data backend supporting import and handling of MS/MS spectra from NIST MSP Format (msp) files. Import of data from files with different MSP *flavours* is supported. Objects from this package add support for MSP files to Bioconductor's Spectra package. This package is thus not supposed to be used without the Spectra package that provides a complete infrastructure for MS data handling.
