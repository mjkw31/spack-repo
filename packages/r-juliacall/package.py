class RJuliacall(RPackage):
	"""Seamless Integration Between R and 'Julia'

	Provides an R interface to 'Julia',
	which is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language
	for numerical computing, see <https://julialang.org/> for more information.
	It provides a high-level interface as well as a low-level interface.
	Using the high level interface, you could call any 'Julia' function just like
	any R function with automatic type conversion. Using the low level interface,
	you could deal with C-level SEXP directly while enjoying the convenience of
	using a high-level programming language like 'Julia'.
