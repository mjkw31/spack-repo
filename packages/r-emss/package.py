	"""Some EM-Type Estimation Methods for the Heckman Selection Model

	Some EM-type algorithms to estimate parameters for the well-known Heckman selection model are provided in the package. Such algorithms are as follow: ECM(Expectation/Conditional Maximization), ECM(NR)(the Newton-Raphson method is adapted to the ECM) and ECME(Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either). Since the algorithms are based on the EM algorithm, they also have EMâ€™s main advantages, namely, stability and ease of implementation. Further details and explanations of the algorithms can be found in Zhao et al. (2020) <doi: 10.1016/j.csda.2020.106930>.
