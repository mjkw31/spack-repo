class RGlmulti(RPackage):
	"""Model Selection and Multimodel Inference Made Easy

	Automated model selection and model-averaging. Provides a
		wrapper for glm and other functions, automatically generating
		all possible models (under constraints set by the user) with
		the specified response and explanatory variables, and finding
		the best models in terms of some Information Criterion (AIC,
		AICc or BIC). Can handle very large numbers of candidate
		models. Features a Genetic Algorithm to find the best models
		when an exhaustive screening of the candidates is not feasible.
