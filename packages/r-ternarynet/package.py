class RTernarynet(RPackage):
	"""Ternary Network Estimation

	Gene-regulatory network (GRN) modeling seeks to infer dependencies between genes and thereby provide insight into the regulatory relationships that exist within a cell. This package provides a computational Bayesian approach to GRN estimation from perturbation experiments using a ternary network model, in which gene expression is discretized into one of 3 states: up, unchanged, or down). The ternarynet package includes a parallel implementation of the replica exchange Monte Carlo algorithm for fitting network models, using MPI.
