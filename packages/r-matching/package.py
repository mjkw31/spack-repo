class RMatching(RPackage):
	"""Multivariate and Propensity Score Matching with Balance
Optimization

	Provides functions for multivariate and propensity score matching 
             and for finding optimal balance based on a genetic search algorithm. 
             A variety of univariate and multivariate metrics to
             determine if balance has been obtained are also provided. For
             details, see the paper by Jasjeet Sekhon 
             (2007, <doi:10.18637/jss.v042.i07>).
