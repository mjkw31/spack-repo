class RCrisprscoredata(RPackage):
	"""Pre-trained models for the crisprScore package

	Provides an interface to access pre-trained models for on-target and off-target gRNA activity prediction algorithms implemented in the crisprScore package. Pre-trained model data are stored in the ExperimentHub database. Users should consider using the crisprScore package directly to use and load the pre-trained models.
