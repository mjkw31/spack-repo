class RMetabcombiner(RPackage):
	"""Method for Combining LC-MS Metabolomics Feature Measurements

	This package aligns LC-HRMS metabolomics datasets acquired from biologically similar specimens analyzed under similar, but not necessarily identical, conditions. Peak-picked and simply aligned metabolomics feature tables (consisting of m/z, rt, and per-sample abundance measurements, plus optional identifiers & adduct annotations) are accepted as input. The package outputs a combined table of feature pair alignments, organized into groups of similar m/z, and ranked by a similarity score. Input tables are assumed to be acquired using similar (but not necessarily identical) analytical methods.
