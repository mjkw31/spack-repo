	"""Coefficients of Interrater Reliability â€“ Generalized for
Randomly Incomplete Datasets

	Provides coefficients of interrater reliability that are generalized to cope with randomly incomplete (i.e. unbalanced) datasets without any imputation of missing values or any (row-wise or column-wise) omissions of actually available data. Applied to complete (balanced) datasets, these generalizations yield the same results as the common procedures, namely the Intraclass Correlation according to McGraw & Wong (1996) doi{10.1037/1082-989X.1.1.30} and the Coefficient of Concordance according to Kendall & Babington Smith (1939) doi{10.1214/aoms/1177732186}.
