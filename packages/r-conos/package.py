class RConos(RPackage):
	"""Clustering on Network of Samples

	Wires together large collections of single-cell RNA-seq datasets, which allows for both the identification of recurrent cell clusters and the propagation of information between datasets in multi-sample or atlas-scale collections. 'Conos' focuses on the uniform mapping of homologous cell types across heterogeneous sample collections. For instance, users could investigate a collection of dozens of peripheral blood samples from cancer patients combined with dozens of controls, which perhaps includes samples of a related tissue such as lymph nodes. This package interacts with data available through the 'conosPanel' package, which is available in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package, see the instructions at <https://github.com/kharchenkolab/conos>. The size of the 'conosPanel' package is approximately 12 MB.
