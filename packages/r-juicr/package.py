	"""Automated and Manual Extraction of Numerical Data from
Scientific Images

	Provides a GUI interface for automating data extraction from 
  multiple images containing scatter and bar plots, semi-automated tools to tinker 
  with extraction attempts, and a fully-loaded point-and-click manual extractor 
  with image zoom, calibrator, and classifier. Also provides detailed and 
  R-independent extraction reports as fully-embedded .html records.
