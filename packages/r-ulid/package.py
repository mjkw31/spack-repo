	"""Generate Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable
Identifiers

	Universally unique identifiers ('UUIDs') can be suboptimal
		for many uses-cases because they aren't the most character
		efficient way of encoding 128 bits of randomness; v1/v2 versions
		are impractical in many environments, as they require access to a
		unique, stable MAC address; v3/v5 versions require a unique seed
		and produce randomly distributed IDs, which can cause
		fragmentation in many data structures; v4 provides no other
		information than randomness which can cause fragmentation in many
		data structures. 'ULIDs' (<https://github.com/ulid/spec>) have
		128-bit compatibility with 'UUID', 1.21e+24 unique 'ULIDs' per
		millisecond, are lexicographically sortable, canonically encoded
		as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character 'UUID',
		use Crockford's 'base32' for better efficiency and readability (5
		bits per character), are case insensitive, have no special
		characters (i.e. are 'URL' safe) and have a onotonic sort order
		(correctly detects and handles the same millisecond).
