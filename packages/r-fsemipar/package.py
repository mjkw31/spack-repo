class RFsemipar(RPackage):
	"""Estimation, Variable Selection and Prediction for Functional
Semiparametric Models

	Routines for estimation or simultaneous estimation and variable selection of
  several functional semiparametric models with scalar response, such as the functional single-index model, 
  the semi-functional partial linear model or the semi-functional partial linear single-index model. 
  In addition, it includes algorithms for dealing with scalar covariates with linear effect coming from the discretization
  of a curve in the cases of the linear model, the multi-functional partial linear model
  and the multi-functional partial linear single-index model.
