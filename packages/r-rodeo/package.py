class RRodeo(RPackage):
	"""A Code Generator for ODE-Based Models

	Provides an R6 class and several utility methods to
	facilitate the implementation of models based on ordinary
	differential equations. The heart of the package is a code generator
	that creates compiled 'Fortran' (or 'R') code which can be passed to
	a numerical solver. There is direct support for solvers contained
	in packages 'deSolve' and 'rootSolve'.
