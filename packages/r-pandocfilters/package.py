class RPandocfilters(RPackage):
	"""Pandoc Filters for R

	The document converter 'pandoc' <https://pandoc.org/> is widely used
	in the R community. One feature of 'pandoc' is that it can produce and consume
	JSON-formatted abstract syntax trees (AST). This allows to transform a given
	source document into JSON-formatted AST, alter it by so called filters and pass
	the altered JSON-formatted AST back to 'pandoc'. This package provides functions
	which allow to write such filters in native R code. 
	Although this package is inspired by the Python package 'pandocfilters' 
	<https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/>, it provides additional convenience functions which make it simple to use the 'pandocfilters' package as a 
	report generator. Since 'pandocfilters' inherits most of it's functionality
	from 'pandoc' it can create documents in many formats 
	(for more information see <https://pandoc.org/>) but is also bound to the same
	limitations as 'pandoc'.
