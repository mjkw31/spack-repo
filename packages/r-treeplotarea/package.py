	"""Correction Factors for Tree Plot Areas Intersected by Stand
Boundaries

	The German national forest inventory uses angle count sampling, 
    a sampling method first published as `Bitterlich, W.: Die Winkelz√§hlmessung.
    Allgemeine Forst- und Holzwirtschaftliche Zeitung, 58. Jahrg., Folge 11/12 
    vom Juni 1947` and extended by Grosenbaugh
    (<https://academic.oup.com/jof/article-abstract/50/1/32/4684174>)
    as probability proportional to size sampling.
    When plots are located near stand boundaries, their sizes and hence
    their probabilities need to be corrected.
