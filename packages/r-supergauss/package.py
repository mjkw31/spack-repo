class RSupergauss(RPackage):
	"""Superfast Likelihood Inference for Stationary Gaussian Time
Series

	Likelihood evaluations for stationary Gaussian time series are typically obtained via the Durbin-Levinson algorithm, which scales as O(n^2) in the number of time series observations.  This package provides a "superfast" O(n log^2 n) algorithm written in C++, crossing over with Durbin-Levinson around n = 300.  Efficient implementations of the score and Hessian functions are also provided, leading to superfast versions of inference algorithms such as Newton-Raphson and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  The C++ code provides a Toeplitz matrix class packaged as a header-only library, to simplify low-level usage in other packages and outside of R.
