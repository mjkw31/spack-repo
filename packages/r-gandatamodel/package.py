	"""Build a Metric Subspaces Data Model for a Data Source

	Neural networks are applied to create a density value function which approximates density values for a data source. The trained neural network is analyzed for different levels. For each level metric subspaces with density values above a level are determined. The obtained set of metric subspaces and the trained neural network are assembled into a data model. A prerequisite is the definition of a data source, the generation of generative data and the calculation of density values. These tasks are executed using package 'ganGenerativeData' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ganGenerativeData>.
