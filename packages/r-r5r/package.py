class RR5r(RPackage):
	"""Rapid Realistic Routing with 'R5'

	Rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks
	(walk, bike, public transport and car) using 'R5', the Rapid Realistic
	Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks engine
	<https://github.com/conveyal/r5>. The package allows users to generate
	detailed routing analysis or calculate travel time matrices using
	seamless parallel computing on top of the R5 Java machine.  While R5
	is developed by Conveyal, the package r5r is independently developed
	by a team at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea) with
	contributions from collaborators. Apart from the documentation in this
	package, users will find additional information on R5 documentation at
	<https://docs.conveyal.com/>. Although we try to keep new releases of
	r5r in synchrony with R5, the development of R5 follows Conveyal's
	independent update process. Hence, users should confirm the R5 version
	implied by the Conveyal user manual (see
	<https://docs.conveyal.com/changelog>) corresponds with the R5 version
	that r5r depends on.
