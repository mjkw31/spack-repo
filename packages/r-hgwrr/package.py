	"""Hierarchical and Geographically Weighted Regression

	This model divides coefficients into three types,
		i.e., local fixed effects, global fixed effects, and random effects (Hu et al., 2022)<doi:10.1177/23998083211063885>.
		If data have spatial hierarchical structures (especially are overlapping on some locations),
		it is worth trying this model to reach better fitness.
