class RTabr(RPackage):
	"""Music Notation Syntax, Manipulation, Analysis and Transcription
in R

	Provides a music notation syntax and a collection of music 
	programming functions for generating, manipulating, organizing, and analyzing 
	musical information in R. Music syntax can be entered directly in character 
	strings, for example to quickly transcribe short pieces of music. The 
	package contains functions for directly performing various mathematical, 
	logical and organizational operations and musical transformations on special 
	object classes that facilitate working with music data and notation. The 
	same music data can be organized in tidy data frames for a familiar and 
	powerful approach to the analysis of large amounts of structured music data. 
	Functions are available for mapping seamlessly between these formats and 
	their representations of musical information. The package also provides an 
	API to 'LilyPond' (<https://lilypond.org/>) for transcribing musical 
	representations in R into tablature ("tabs") and sheet music. 'LilyPond' is 
	open source music engraving software for generating high quality sheet music 
	based on markup syntax. The package generates 'LilyPond' files from R code 
	and can pass them to the 'LilyPond' command line interface to be rendered 
	into sheet music PDF files or inserted into R markdown documents. The 
	package offers nominal MIDI file output support in conjunction with
	rendering sheet music. The package can read MIDI files and attempts to
	structure the MIDI data to integrate as best as possible with the data
	structures and functionality found throughout the package.
