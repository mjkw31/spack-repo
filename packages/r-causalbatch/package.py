class RCausalbatch(RPackage):
	"""Causal Batch Effects

	Software which provides numerous functionalities for detecting and removing group-level effects from high-dimensional scientific data which, when combined with additional assumptions, allow for causal conclusions, as-described in our manuscripts Bridgeford et al. (2024) <doi:10.1101/2021.09.03.458920> and Bridgeford et al. (2023) <arXiv:2307.13868>. Also provides a number of useful utilities for generating simulations and balancing covariates across multiple groups/batches of data via matching and propensity trimming for more than two groups.
