class RFracture(RPackage):
	"""Convert Decimals to Fractions

	Provides functions for converting decimals to a
	matrix of numerators and denominators or a character vector of
	fractions.  Supports mixed or improper fractions, finding common
	denominators for vectors of fractions, limiting denominators to powers
	of ten, and limiting denominators to a maximum value.  Also includes
	helper functions for finding the least common multiple and greatest
	common divisor for a vector of integers.  Implemented using C++ for
	maximum speed.
