	"""SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 149)

	SNP locations and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build 149. The source data files used for this package were created by NCBI between November 8-12, 2016, and contain SNPs mapped to reference genome GRCh38.p7 (a patched version of GRCh38 that doesn't alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT). Note that these SNPs can be "injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.GRCh38 or in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.
