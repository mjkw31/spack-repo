class RDelaporte(RPackage):
	"""Statistical Functions for the Delaporte Distribution

	Provides probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate
	generation, and method-of-moments parameter-estimation functions for the
	Delaporte distribution with parameterization based on Vose (2008)
	<isbn:9780470512845>. The Delaporte is a discrete probability distribution
	which can be considered the convolution of a negative binomial distribution
	with a Poisson distribution. Alternatively, it can be considered a counting
	distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial components. It has been
	studied in actuarial science as a frequency distribution which has more
	variability than the Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
