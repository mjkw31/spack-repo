class RHellorust(RPackage):
	"""Minimal Examples of Using Rust Code in R

	Template R package with minimal setup to use Rust code in R without
	hacks or frameworks. Includes basic examples of importing cargo dependencies,
	spawning threads and passing numbers or strings from Rust to R. Cargo crates
	are automatically 'vendored' in the R source package to support offline
	installation. The GitHub repository for this package has more details and also 
	explains how to set up CI. This project was first presented at 'Erum2018' to 
	showcase R-Rust integration <https://jeroen.github.io/erum2018/>; for a real
	world use-case, see the 'gifski' package on 'CRAN'.
