	"""Degrees of Freedom Adjustment for Robust Standard Errors

	Computes small-sample degrees of freedom adjustment for
    heteroskedasticity robust standard errors, and for clustered standard errors
    in linear regression. See Imbens and Koles√°r (2016)
    <doi:10.1162/REST_a_00552> for a discussion of these adjustments.
