	"""Fast Searching for Multiple Keywords in Multiple Texts

	Aho-Corasick is an optimal algorithm for finding many
	keywords in a text. It can locate all matches in a text in O(N+M) time; i.e.,
	the time needed scales linearly with the number of keywords (N) and the size of
	the text (M). Compare this to the naive approach which takes O(N*M) time to loop
	through each pattern and scan for it in the text. This implementation builds the
	trie (the generic name of the data structure) and runs the search in a single
	function call. If you want to search multiple texts with the same trie, the
	function will take a list or vector of texts and return a list of matches to
	each text. By default, all 128 ASCII characters are allowed in both the keywords
	and the text. A more efficient trie is possible if the alphabet size can be
	reduced. For example, DNA sequences use at most 19 distinct characters and
	usually only 4; protein sequences use at most 26 distinct characters and usually
	only 20. UTF-8 (Unicode) matching is not currently supported.
