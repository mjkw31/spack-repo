	"""Bayesian Single-Arm Design with Survival Endpoints

	The proposed event-driven approach for Bayesian two-stage single-arm phase II trial design is a novel clinical trial design and can be regarded as an extension of the Simonâ€™s two-stage design with the time-to-event endpoint. This design is motivated by cancer clinical trials with immunotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy, in which time-to-event endpoint is often a desired endpoint.
