	"""Designing Stated Preference Experiments

	Contemporary software commonly used to design stated preference experiments are expensive and the code is closed source. This is a free software package with an easy to use interface to make flexible stated preference experimental designs using state-of-the-art methods. For an overview of stated choice experimental design theory, see e.g., Rose, J. M. & Bliemer, M. C. J. (2014) in Hess S. & Daly. A. <doi:10.4337/9781781003152>. The package website can be accessed at <https://spdesign.edsandorf.me>. We acknowledge funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant INSPiRE (Grant agreement ID: 793163).
