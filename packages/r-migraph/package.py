class RMigraph(RPackage):
	"""Many Network Measures, Motifs, Members, and Models

	A set of tools for analysing multimodal networks.
   It includes functions for measuring 
   centrality, centralization, cohesion, closure, constraint and diversity,
   as well as for network block-modelling, regression, and diffusion models.
   The package is released as a complement to 
   'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000),
   and includes various datasets used in the book.
   Built on the 'manynet' package, all functions operate with matrices, edge lists, 
   and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
