	"""Bayesian Analysis of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect

	It is vital to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects
	(HTE) when making health care decisions for an individual patient or a group
	of patients. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to evaluate HTE based
	on information collected from clinical studies that are often designed and
	conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for the overall population.
	The Bayesian framework offers a principled and flexible approach to estimate
	and compare treatment effects across subgroups of patients defined by their
	characteristics. This package allows users to explore a wide range of Bayesian
	HTE analysis models, and produce posterior inferences about HTE. See Wang et al.
	(2018) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v085.i07> for further details.
