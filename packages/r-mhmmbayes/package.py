	"""Multilevel Hidden Markov Models Using Bayesian Estimation

	An implementation of the multilevel (also known as mixed or random 
	effects) hidden Markov model using Bayesian estimation in R. The multilevel 
	hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of the well-known hidden
	Markov model, for the latter see Rabiner (1989) <doi:10.1109/5.18626>. The 
	multilevel HMM is tailored to accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of 
	multiple individuals simultaneously, see e.g., de Haan-Rietdijk et al. 
	<doi:10.1080/00273171.2017.1370364>. Using a multilevel framework, we allow 
	for heterogeneity in the model parameters (transition probability matrix and 
	conditional distribution), while estimating one overall HMM. The model can 
	be fitted on multivariate data with either a categorical or Normal 
	distribution, and include individual level covariates (allowing for e.g., 
	group comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are estimated using 
	Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion within a hybrid 
	Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. Missing data (NA) in the dependent 
	variables is accommodated assuming MAR. The package also includes various 
	visualization options, a function to simulate data, and a function to obtain 
	the most likely hidden state sequence for each individual using the Viterbi 
	algorithm.
