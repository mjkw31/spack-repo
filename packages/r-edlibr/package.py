	"""R Integration for Edlib, the C/C++ Library for Exact Pairwise
Sequence Alignment using Edit (Levenshtein) Distance

	Bindings to edlib, a lightweight performant C/C++ library for exact pairwise sequence alignment using edit distance (Levenshtein distance). The algorithm computes the optimal alignment path, but also can be used to find only the start and/or end of the alignment path for convenience. Edlib was designed to be ultrafast and require little memory, with the capability to handle very large sequences. Three alignment methods are supported: global (Needleman-Wunsch), infix (Hybrid Wunsch), and prefix (Semi-Hybrid Wunsch). The original C/C++ library is described in "Edlib: a C/C++ library for fast, exact sequence alignment using edit distance", M. Šošić, M. Šikić, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw753>.
