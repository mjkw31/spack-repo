	"""Vault Client for Secrets and Sensitive Data

	Provides an interface to a 'HashiCorp' vault server over
  its http API (typically these are self-hosted; see
  <https://www.vaultproject.io>).  This allows for secure storage and
  retrieval of secrets over a network, such as tokens, passwords and
  certificates.  Authentication with vault is supported through
  several backends including user name/password and authentication via
  'GitHub'.
