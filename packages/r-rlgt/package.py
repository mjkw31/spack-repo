class RRlgt(RPackage):
	"""Bayesian Exponential Smoothing Models with Trend Modifications

	An implementation of a number of Global Trend models for time series forecasting 
	that are Bayesian generalizations and extensions of some Exponential Smoothing models. 
	The main differences/additions include 1) nonlinear global trend, 2) Student-t error 
	distribution, and 3) a function for the error size, so heteroscedasticity. The methods 
	are particularly useful for short time series. When tested on the well-known M3 dataset,
	they are able to outperform all classical time series algorithms. The models are fitted 
	with MCMC using the 'rstan' package.
