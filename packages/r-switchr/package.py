class RSwitchr(RPackage):
	"""Installing, Managing, and Switching Between Distinct Sets of
Installed Packages

	Provides an abstraction for managing, installing,
	and switching between sets of installed R packages. This allows users to
	maintain multiple package libraries simultaneously, e.g. to maintain
	strict, package-version-specific reproducibility of many analyses, or
	work within a development/production release paradigm. Introduces a
	generalized package installation process which supports multiple repository
	and non-repository sources and tracks package provenance.
