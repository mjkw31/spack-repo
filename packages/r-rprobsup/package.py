	"""Calculates Probability of Superiority

	The A() function calculates the A statistic, a nonparametric
    measure of effect size for two independent groups thatâ€™s also known as
    the probability of superiority (Ruscio, 2008), along with its standard
    error and a confidence interval constructed using bootstrap methods 
    (Ruscio & Mullen, 2012). Optional arguments can be specified to 
    calculate variants of the A statistic developed for other research 
    designs (e.g., related samples, more than two independent groups or 
    related samples; Ruscio & Gera, 2013).
