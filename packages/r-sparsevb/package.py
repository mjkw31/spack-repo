class RSparsevb(RPackage):
	"""Spike-and-Slab Variational Bayes for Linear and Logistic
Regression

	Implements variational Bayesian algorithms to perform scalable variable selection for sparse, high-dimensional linear and logistic regression models. Features include a novel prioritized updating scheme, which uses a preliminary estimator of the variational means during initialization to generate an updating order prioritizing large, more relevant, coefficients. Sparsity is induced via spike-and-slab priors with either Laplace or Gaussian slabs. By default, the heavier-tailed Laplace density is used. Formal derivations of the algorithms and asymptotic consistency results may be found in Kolyan Ray and Botond Szabo (2020) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1847121> and Kolyan Ray, Botond Szabo, and Gabriel Clara (2020) <arXiv:2010.11665>.
