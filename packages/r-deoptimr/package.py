	"""Differential Evolution Optimization in Pure R.

	Differential Evolution (DE) stochastic algorithms for global optimization
	of problems with and without constraints. The aim is to curate a collection
	of its state-of-the-art variants that (1) do not sacrifice simplicity of
	design, (2) are essentially tuning-free, and (3) can be efficiently
	implemented directly in the R language. Currently, it only provides an
	implementation of the 'jDE' algorithm by Brest et al. (2006)
	<doi:10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133>."""
