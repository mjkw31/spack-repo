class RNanonext(RPackage):
	"""NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library

	R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is
	a socket library implementing 'Scalability Protocols', a reliable,
	high-performance standard for common communications patterns including
	publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery, over in-process,
	IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. As its own threaded
	concurrency framework, provides a toolkit for asynchronous programming and
	distributed computing, with intuitive 'aio' objects which resolve
	automatically upon completion of asynchronous operations, and
	synchronisation primitives allowing R to wait upon events signalled by
	concurrent threads.
