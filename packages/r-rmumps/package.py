class RRmumps(RPackage):
	"""Wrapper for MUMPS Library

	Some basic features of 'MUMPS' (Multifrontal Massively Parallel
		 sparse direct Solver) are wrapped in a class whose methods can be used
		 for sequentially solving a sparse linear system (symmetric or not)
		 with one or many right hand sides (dense or sparse).
		 There is a possibility to do separately symbolic analysis,
		 LU (or LDL^t) factorization and system solving.
		 Third part ordering libraries are included and can be used: 'PORD', 'METIS', 'SCOTCH'.
		 'MUMPS' method was first described in Amestoy et al. (2001) <doi:10.1137/S0895479899358194>
		 and Amestoy et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.parco.2005.07.004>.
