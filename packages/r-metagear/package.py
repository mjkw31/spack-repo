	"""Comprehensive Research Synthesis Tools for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analysis

	Functionalities for facilitating systematic reviews, data
	extractions, and meta-analyses. It includes a GUI (graphical user interface)
	to help screen the abstracts and titles of bibliographic data; tools to assign
	screening effort across multiple collaborators/reviewers and to assess inter-
	reviewer reliability; tools to help automate the download and retrieval of
	journal PDF articles from online databases; figure and image extractions 
	from PDFs; web scraping of citations; automated and manual data extraction 
	from scatter-plot and bar-plot images; PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
	Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagrams; simple imputation tools
	to fill gaps in incomplete or missing study parameters; generation of random
	effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response ratio, odds ratio, and correlation
	coefficients for Monte Carlo experiments; covariance equations for modelling
	dependencies among multiple effect sizes (e.g., effect sizes with a common
	control); and finally summaries that replicate analyses and outputs from 
	widely used but no longer updated meta-analysis software (i.e., metawin).
	Funding for this package was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) 
	grants DBI-1262545 and DEB-1451031. CITE: Lajeunesse, M.J. (2016) 
	Facilitating systematic reviews, data extraction and meta-analysis with the 
	metagear package for R. Methods in Ecology and Evolution 7, 323-330
