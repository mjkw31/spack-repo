	"""Gene Set Enrichment / Projection Displays

	R/GSEPD is a bioinformatics package for R to help disambiguate transcriptome samples (a matrix of RNA-Seq counts at transcript IDs) by automating differential expression (with DESeq2), then gene set enrichment (with GOSeq), and finally a N-dimensional projection to quantify in which ways each sample is like either treatment group.
