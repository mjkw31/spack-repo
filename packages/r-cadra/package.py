	"""Candidate Driver Analysis

	Performs both stepwise and backward heuristic search for candidate (epi)genetic drivers based on a binary multi-omics dataset. CaDrA's main objective is to identify features which, together, are significantly skewed or enriched pertaining to a given vector of continuous scores (e.g. sample-specific scores representing a phenotypic readout of interest, such as protein expression, pathway activity, etc.), based on the union occurence (i.e. logical OR) of the events.
