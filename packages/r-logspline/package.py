class RLogspline(RPackage):
	"""Routines for Logspline Density Estimation

	Contains routines for logspline density estimation.
	The function oldlogspline() uses the same algorithm as the logspline package
	version 1.0.x; i.e. the Kooperberg and Stone (1992) 
	algorithm (with an improved interface).  The recommended routine logspline()
	uses an algorithm from Stone et al (1997)  <DOI:10.1214/aos/1031594728>.
