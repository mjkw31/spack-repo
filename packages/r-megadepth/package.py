class RMegadepth(RPackage):
	"""megadepth: BigWig and BAM related utilities

	This package provides an R interface to Megadepth by Christopher Wilks available at https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth. It is particularly useful for computing the coverage of a set of genomic regions across bigWig or BAM files. With this package, you can build base-pair coverage matrices for regions or annotations of your choice from BigWig files. Megadepth was used to create the raw files provided by https://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3.
