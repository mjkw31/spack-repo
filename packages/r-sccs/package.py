	"""The Self-Controlled Case Series Method

	Various self-controlled case series models used to investigate 
        associations between time-varying exposures such as vaccines or
        other drugs or non drug exposures and an adverse event can be
        fitted. Detailed information on the self-controlled case series
        method and its extensions with more examples can be found in 
        Farrington, P., Whitaker, H., and Ghebremichael Weldeselassie, Y.
