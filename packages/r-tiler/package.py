class RTiler(RPackage):
	"""Create Geographic and Non-Geographic Map Tiles

	Creates geographic map tiles from geospatial map files or 
	non-geographic map tiles from simple image files. This package provides a 
	tile generator function for creating map tile sets for use with packages 
	such as 'leaflet'. In addition to generating map tiles based on a common 
	raster layer source, it also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing 
	map tiles from arbitrary images. These map tiles, which have a 
	non-geographic, simple coordinate reference system (CRS), can also be used 
	with 'leaflet' when applying the simple CRS option. Map tiles can be created 
	from an input file with any of the following extensions: tif, grd and nc for 
	spatial maps and png, jpg and bmp for basic images. This package requires 
	'Python' and the 'gdal' library for 'Python'. 'Windows' users are 
	recommended to install 'OSGeo4W' (<https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>) as an 
	easy way to obtain the required 'gdal' support for 'Python'.
