	"""Cluster Analysis via Random Partition Distributions

	Cluster analysis is performed using pairwise distance information and a random partition distribution. The method is
			 implemented for two random partition distributions. It draws samples and then obtains and plots clustering estimates.
			 An implementation of a selection algorithm is provided for the mass parameter of the partition distribution. Since 
			 pairwise distances are the principal input to this procedure, it is most comparable to the hierarchical and k-medoids
			 clustering methods. The method is Dahl, Andros, Carter (2022+) <doi:10.1002/sam.11602>.
