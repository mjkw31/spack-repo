class REcodiet(RPackage):
	"""Estimating a Diet Matrix from Biotracer and Stomach Content Data

	Biotracers and stomach content analyses are combined in a Bayesian hierarchical model
	to estimate a probabilistic topology matrix (all trophic link probabilities) and a diet matrix 
	(all diet proportions).
	The package relies on the JAGS software and the 'jagsUI' package to run a Markov chain Monte Carlo 
	approximation of the different variables.
