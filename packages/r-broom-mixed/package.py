class RBroomMixed(RPackage):
	"""Tidying Methods for Mixed Models

	Convert fitted objects from various R mixed-model packages
    into tidy data frames along the lines of the 'broom' package.
    The package provides three
    S3 generics for each model: tidy(), which summarizes a model's statistical findings such as
    coefficients of a regression; augment(), which adds columns to the original
    data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance(), which
    provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
