	"""Set of Common Tools for Forecast Verification

	Set of tools to verify forecasts through the computation of typical
	prediction scores against one or more observational datasets or reanalyses (a
	reanalysis being a physical extrapolation of observations that relies on the
	equations from a model, not a pure observational dataset). Intended for seasonal
	to decadal climate forecasts although can be useful to verify other kinds of
	forecasts. The package can be helpful in climate sciences for other purposes
	than forecasting. To find more details, see the review paper Manubens, N.et al. (2018)
	<doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.01.018>.
