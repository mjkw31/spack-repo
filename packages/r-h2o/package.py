	"""R Interface for the 'H2O' Scalable Machine Learning Platform

	R interface for 'H2O', the scalable open source machine learning
	platform that offers parallelized implementations of many supervised and
	unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear
	Models (GLM), Gradient Boosting Machines (including XGBoost), Random Forests,
	Deep Neural Networks (Deep Learning), Stacked Ensembles, Naive Bayes,
	Generalized Additive Models (GAM), ANOVA GLM, Cox Proportional Hazards, K-Means, PCA, ModelSelection,
	Word2Vec, as well as a fully automatic machine learning algorithm (H2O AutoML).
