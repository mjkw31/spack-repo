	"""Optimal Project Prioritization

	A decision support tool for prioritizing conservation projects.
	Prioritizations can be developed by maximizing expected feature richness,
	expected phylogenetic diversity, the number of features that meet
	persistence targets, or identifying a set of projects that meet persistence
	targets for minimal cost. Constraints (e.g. lock in specific actions) and
	feature weights can also be specified to further customize prioritizations.
	After defining a project prioritization problem, solutions can be obtained
	using exact algorithms, heuristic algorithms, or random processes. In
	particular, it is recommended to install the 'Gurobi' optimizer (available
	from <https://www.gurobi.com>) because it can identify optimal solutions
	very quickly. Finally, methods are provided for comparing different
	prioritizations and evaluating their benefits. For more information, see
	Hanson et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13264>.
