	"""High-Dimensional Shrinkage Optimal Portfolios

	Constructs shrinkage estimators of high-dimensional mean-variance portfolios and performs 
    high-dimensional tests on optimality of a given portfolio. The techniques developed in 
    Bodnar et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.028>, Bodnar et al. (2019) 
    <doi:10.1109/TSP.2019.2929964>, Bodnar et al. (2020) <doi:10.1109/TSP.2020.3037369> 
    are central to the package. They provide simple and feasible estimators and tests for optimal 
    portfolio weights, which are applicable for 'large p and large n' situations where p is the 
    portfolio dimension (number of stocks) and n is the sample size. The package also includes tools
    for constructing portfolios based on shrinkage estimators of the mean vector and covariance matrix
    as well as a new Bayesian estimator for the Markowitz efficient frontier recently developed by 
    Bauder et al. (2021) <doi:10.1080/14697688.2020.1748214>.
