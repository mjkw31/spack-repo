class RSpacefillr(RPackage):
	"""Space-Filling Random and Quasi-Random Sequences

	Generates random and quasi-random space-filling sequences. Supports the following sequences: 'Halton', 'Sobol', 'Owen'-scrambled 'Sobol',  'Owen'-scrambled 'Sobol' with errors distributed as blue noise, progressive jittered, progressive multi-jittered ('PMJ'), 'PMJ' with blue noise, 'PMJ02', and 'PMJ02' with blue noise. Includes a 'C++' 'API'. Methods derived from "Constructing Sobol sequences with better two-dimensional projections" (2012) <doi:10.1137/070709359> S. Joe and F. Y. Kuo, "Progressive Multi-Jittered Sample Sequences" (2018) <https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProgressiveMultiJitteredSampling/paper.pdf> Christensen, P., Kensler, A. and Kilpatrick, C., and "A Low-Discrepancy Sampler that Distributes Monte Carlo Errors as a Blue Noise in Screen Space" (2019) E.
