class RSimmer(RPackage):
	"""Discrete-Event Simulation for R

	A process-oriented and trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation
    (DES) package for R. It is designed as a generic yet powerful framework. The
    architecture encloses a robust and fast simulation core written in 'C++' with
    automatic monitoring capabilities. It provides a rich and flexible R API that
    revolves around the concept of trajectory, a common path in the simulation
    model for entities of the same type. Documentation about 'simmer' is provided
    by several vignettes included in this package, via the paper by Ucar, Smeets
    & Azcorra (2019, <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i02>), and the paper by Ucar,
    Hern√°ndez, Serrano & Azcorra (2018, <doi:10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700960>);
    see 'citation("simmer")' for details.
