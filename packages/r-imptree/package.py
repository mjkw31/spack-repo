	"""Classification Trees with Imprecise Probabilities

	Creation of imprecise classification trees. They rely on
	probability estimation within each node by means of either the
	imprecise Dirichlet model or the nonparametric predictive
	inference approach. The splitting variable is selected by the
	strategy presented in Fink and Crossman (2013)
	<http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paper&paper=014.html>,
	but also the original imprecise information gain of Abellan and
	Moral (2003) <doi:10.1002/int.10143> is covered.
