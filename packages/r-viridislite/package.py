	"""Colorblind-Friendly Color Maps (Lite Version).

	Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with common
	forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps are
	also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to
	black-and-white for printing. This is the 'lite' version of the 'viridis'
	package that also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous
	color and fill scales and can be found at
	<https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>."""
