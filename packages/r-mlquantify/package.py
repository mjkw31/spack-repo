	"""Algorithms for Class Distribution Estimation

	Quantification is a prominent machine learning task that has received an 
    increasing amount of attention in the last years. The objective is to predict the 
    class distribution of a data sample. This package is a collection of machine learning 
    algorithms for class distribution estimation. This package include algorithms from
    different paradigms of quantification. These methods are described in the paper: 
    A. Maletzke, W. Hassan, D. dos Reis, and G. Batista. The importance of the test set 
    size in quantification assessment. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International 
    Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI20, pages 2640â€“2646, 2020.
