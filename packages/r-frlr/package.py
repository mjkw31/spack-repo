class RFrlr(RPackage):
	"""Fit Repeated Linear Regressions

	When fitting a set of linear regressions which have some same variables, we can separate the matrix and reduce the computation cost. This package aims to fit a set of repeated linear regressions faster. More details can be found in this blog Lijun Wang (2017) <https://stats.hohoweiya.xyz/regression/2017/09/26/An-R-Package-Fit-Repeated-Linear-Regressions/>.
