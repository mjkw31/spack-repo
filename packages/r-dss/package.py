	"""Dispersion shrinkage for sequencing data.

	DSS is an R library performing differntial analysis for count-based
	sequencing data. It detectes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from
	RNA-seq, and differentially methylated loci or regions (DML/DMRs) from
	bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). The core of DSS is a new dispersion
	shrinkage method for estimating the dispersion parameter from Gamma-Poisson
	or Beta-Binomial distributions."""
