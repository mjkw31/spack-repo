	"""A Generator of Multidimensional Noise

	Generation of natural looking noise has many application within 
	simulation, procedural generation, and art, to name a few. The 'ambient' 
	package provides an interface to the 'FastNoise' C++ library and allows for
	efficient generation of perlin, simplex, worley, cubic, value, and white 
	noise with optional perturbation in either 2, 3, or 4 (in case of simplex and
	white noise) dimensions.
