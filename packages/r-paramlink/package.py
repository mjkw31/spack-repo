class RParamlink(RPackage):
	"""Parametric Linkage and Other Pedigree Analysis in R

	NOTE: 'PARAMLINK' HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY THE 'PED SUITE'
	PACKAGES (<https://magnusdv.github.io/pedsuite/>). 'PARAMLINK' IS
	MAINTAINED ONLY FOR LEGACY PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN NEW
	PROJECTS. A suite of tools for analysing pedigrees with marker data,
	including parametric linkage analysis, forensic computations,
	relatedness analysis and marker simulations. The core of the package
	is an implementation of the Elston-Stewart algorithm for pedigree
	likelihoods, extended to allow mutations as well as complex
	inbreeding. Features for linkage analysis include singlepoint LOD
	scores, power analysis, and multipoint analysis (the latter through a
	wrapper to the 'MERLIN' software). Forensic applications include
	exclusion probabilities, genotype distributions and conditional
	simulations. Data from the 'Familias' software can be imported and
	analysed in 'paramlink'. Finally, 'paramlink' offers many utility
	functions for creating, manipulating and plotting pedigrees with or
	without marker data (the actual plotting is done by the 'kinship2'
	package).
