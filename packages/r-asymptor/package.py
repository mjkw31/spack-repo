	"""Estimate Asymptomatic Cases via Capture/Recapture Methods

	Estimate the lower and upper bound of asymptomatic cases in an 
    epidemic using the capture/recapture methods from BÃ¶hning et al. (2020) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.009> and Rocchetti et al. (2020)
    <doi:10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445>. Note there is currently some discussion
    about the validity of the methods implemented in this package. You should
    read carefully the original articles, alongside this answer from Li et al.
    (2022) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2209.11334> before using this package in your
