class RGenomicranges(RPackage):
	"""Representation and manipulation of genomic intervals.

	The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations
	and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyzing
	high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges
	package defines general purpose containers for storing and manipulating
	genomic intervals and variables defined along a genome. More specialized
	containers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a
	reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are
	defined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages,
	respectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges
	infrastructure."""
