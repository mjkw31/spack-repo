class RRedux(RPackage):
	"""R Bindings to 'hiredis'

	A 'hiredis' wrapper that includes support for
	transactions, pipelining, blocking subscription, serialisation of
	all keys and values, 'Redis' error handling with R errors.
	Includes an automatically generated 'R6' interface to the full
	'hiredis' API.  Generated functions are faithful to the
	'hiredis' documentation while attempting to match R's argument
	semantics.  Serialisation must be explicitly done by the user, but
	both binary and text-mode serialisation is supported.
