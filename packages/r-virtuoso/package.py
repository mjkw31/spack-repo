class RVirtuoso(RPackage):
	"""Interface to 'Virtuoso' using 'ODBC'

	Provides users with a simple and convenient
			 mechanism to manage and query a 'Virtuoso' database using the 'DBI' (Data-Base Interface)
			 compatible 'ODBC' (Open Database Connectivity) interface.
			 'Virtuoso' is a high-performance "universal server," which can act
			 as both a relational database, supporting standard Structured Query
			 Language ('SQL') queries, while also supporting data following the
			 Resource Description Framework ('RDF') model for Linked Data.
			 'RDF' data can be queried using 'SPARQL' ('SPARQL' Protocol and 'RDF' Query Language)
			 queries, a graph-based query that supports semantic reasoning.
			 This allows users to leverage the performance of local or remote 'Virtuoso' servers using
			 popular 'R' packages such as 'DBI' and 'dplyr', while also providing a 
			 high-performance solution for working with large 'RDF' 'triplestores' from 'R.'
			 The package also provides helper routines to install, launch, and manage
			 a 'Virtuoso' server locally on 'Mac', 'Windows' and 'Linux' platforms using
			 the standard interactive installers from the 'R' command-line.  By 
			 automatically handling these setup steps, the package can make using 'Virtuoso'
			 considerably faster and easier for a most users to deploy in a local
			 environment. Managing the bulk import of triples
			 from common serializations with a single intuitive command is another key
			 feature of this package.  Bulk import performance can be tens to
			 hundreds of times faster than the comparable imports using existing 'R' tools,
			 including 'rdflib' and 'redland' packages.
