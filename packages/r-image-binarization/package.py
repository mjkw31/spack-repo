class RImageBinarization(RPackage):
	"""Binarize Images for Enhancing Optical Character Recognition

	Improve optical character recognition by binarizing images. The package focuses primarily on local adaptive thresholding algorithms. 
	In English, this means that it has the ability to turn a color or gray scale image into a black and white image. This is particularly useful
	as a preprocessing step for optical character recognition or handwritten text recognition.
