class RGdalraster(RPackage):
	"""Bindings to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' Raster API

	Interface to the Raster API of the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction
	Library' ('GDAL') supporting manual creation of uninitialized datasets,
	creation from existing raster as template, low level I/O, configuration of
	virtual raster (VRT), coordinate transformation, and access to 'gdalwarp'
	for reprojection. Includes several 'GDAL' algorithms and functions for
	working with spatial reference systems. Calling signatures resemble the
	native C, C++ and Python APIs provided by the 'GDAL' project
	(<https://gdal.org>). Bindings are implemented via exposed C++ class
	encapsulating a 'GDALDataset' and its associated 'GDALRasterBand' objects,
	plus several stand-alone functions. Additional functionality includes:
	class 'RunningStats' for efficient summary statistics on large data
	streams; class 'CmbTable' for counting unique combinations of integers
	with a hash table; raster 'combine()' to identify and count unique pixel
	combinations across multiple input layers; raster 'calc()' to evaluate
	an R expression on a stack of layers with pixel coordinates available as
	variables in the expression; and raster display using base 'graphics'.
	'gdalraster' may be suitable for applications that primarily need low-level
	I/O or prefer a direct 'GDAL' API. The additional functionality is somewhat
	aimed at thematic data analysis but may have other utility.
