class RRsmlx(RPackage):
	"""R Speaks 'Monolix'

	Provides methods for model building and model evaluation of mixed effects models using 
	'Monolix' <https://monolix.lixoft.com>. 'Monolix' is a software tool for nonlinear mixed effects 
	modeling that must have been installed in order to use 'Rsmlx'. 
	Among other tasks, 'Rsmlx' provides a powerful tool for automatic PK model building, performs 
	statistical tests for model assessment, bootstrap simulation and likelihood profiling for 
	computing confidence intervals. 'Rsmlx' also proposes several automatic covariate search methods for 
	mixed effects models.
