	"""MHC Allele-Based Differencing Between Populations

	Tools for the analysis of population differences
	using the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genotypes of samples
	having a variable number of alleles (1-4) recorded for each
	individual.  A hierarchical Dirichlet-Multinomial model on the
	genotype counts is used to pool small samples from multiple
	populations for pairwise tests of equality.  Bayesian inference is
	implemented via the 'rstan' package.  Bootstrapped and posterior
	p-values are provided for chi-squared and likelihood ratio tests of
	equal genotype probabilities.
