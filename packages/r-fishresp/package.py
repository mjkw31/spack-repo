class RFishresp(RPackage):
	"""Analytical Tool for Aquatic Respirometry

	Calculates metabolic rate of fish and other aquatic organisms measured using
			 an intermittent-flow respirometry approach. The tool is used to run a set of graphical
			 QC tests of raw respirometry data, correct it for background respiration and chamber
			 effect, filter and extract target values of absolute and mass-specific metabolic rate.
			 Experimental design should include background respiration tests and measuring of one
			 or more metabolic rate traits. The R package is ideally integrated with the pump
			 controller 'PumpResp' and the DO meter 'SensResp' (open-source hardware by FishResp).
			 Raw respirometry data can be also imported from 'AquaResp' (free software), 'AutoResp'
			 ('LoligoSystems'), 'OxyView' ('PreSens'), 'Pyro Oxygen Logger' ('PyroScience') and
			 'Q-box Aqua' ('QubitSystems'). More information about the R package 'FishResp'is
			 available in the publication by Morozov et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/conphys/coz003>.
