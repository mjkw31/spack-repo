	"""Functions that Apply to Rows and Columns of Matrices (and to Vectors).

	High-performing functions operating on rows and columns of matrices, e.g.
	col / rowMedians(), col / rowRanks(), and col / rowSds(). Functions
	optimized per data type and for subsetted calculations such that both
	memory usage and processing time is minimized. There are also optimized
	vector-based methods, e.g. binMeans(), madDiff() and weightedMedian()."""
