class RDeconrnaseq(RPackage):
	"""Deconvolution of Heterogeneous Tissue Samples for mRNA-Seq data

	DeconSeq is an R package for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues based on mRNA-Seq data. It modeled expression levels from heterogeneous cell populations in mRNA-Seq as the weighted average of expression from different constituting cell types and predicted cell type proportions of single expression profiles.
