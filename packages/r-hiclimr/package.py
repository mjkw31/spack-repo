class RHiclimr(RPackage):
	"""Hierarchical Climate Regionalization

	A tool for Hierarchical Climate Regionalization applicable to any correlation-based clustering.
			 It adds several features and a new clustering method (called, 'regional' linkage) to hierarchical
			 clustering in R ('hclust' function in 'stats' library): data regridding, coarsening spatial resolution,
			 geographic masking, contiguity-constrained clustering, data filtering by mean and/or variance
			 thresholds, data preprocessing (detrending, standardization, and PCA), faster correlation function
			 with preliminary big data support, different clustering methods, hybrid hierarchical clustering,
			 multivariate clustering (MVC), cluster validation, visualization of regionalization results, and
			 exporting region map and mean timeseries into NetCDF-4 file.
			 The technical details are described in Badr et al. (2015) <doi:10.1007/s12145-015-0221-7>.
