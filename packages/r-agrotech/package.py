class RAgrotech(RPackage):
	"""Data Analysis of Pesticide Application Technology

	In total it has 7 functions, three for calculating machine calibration, which determine application rate (L/ha), nozzle flow (L/min) and amount of product (L or kg) to be added. to the tank with each sprayer filling. Two functions for graphs of the flow distribution of the nozzles (L/min) in the application bar and, of the temporal variability of the meteorological conditions (air temperature, relative humidity of the air and wind speed). Two functions to determine the spray deposit (uL/cm2), through the methodology called spectrophotometry, with the aid of bright blue (Palladini, L.A., Raetano, C.G., Velini, E.D. (2005), <doi:10.1590/S0103-90162005000500005>) or metallic markers (Chaim, A., Castro, V.L.S.S., Correles, F.M., Galv√£o, J.A.H., Cabral, O.M.R., Nicolella, G. (1999), <doi:10.1590/S0100-204X1999000500003>). The package supports the analysis and representation of information, using a single free software that meets the most diverse areas of activity in application technology.
