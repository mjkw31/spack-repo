	"""Docker Client

	Work with containers over the Docker API.  Rather than
	using system calls to interact with a docker client, using the
	API directly means that we can receive richer information from
	docker.  The interface in the package is automatically generated
	using the 'OpenAPI' (a.k.a., 'swagger') specification, and all
	return values are checked in order to make them type stable.
