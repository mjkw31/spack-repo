class RHttpuv(RPackage):
	"""HTTP and WebSocket Server Library.

	Provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling HTTP and
	WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily intended as a
	building block for other packages, rather than making it particularly easy
	to create complete web applications using httpuv alone. httpuv is built on
	top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of which were developed
	by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser license
	information.)"""
