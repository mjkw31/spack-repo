class RGenie(RPackage):
	"""Fast, Robust, and Outlier Resistant Hierarchical Clustering

	Includes the reference implementation of Genie - a hierarchical
	clustering algorithm that links two point groups in such a way that
	an inequity measure (namely, the Gini index) of the cluster sizes
	does not significantly increase above a given threshold.
	This method most often outperforms many other data segmentation approaches
	in terms of clustering quality as tested on a wide range of benchmark
	datasets. At the same time, Genie retains the high speed of the single
	linkage approach, therefore it is also suitable for analysing larger data sets.
	For more details see (Gagolewski et al. 2016 <DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2016.05.003>).
	For an even faster and more feature-rich implementation, including,
	amongst others, noise point detection, see the 'genieclust' package.
