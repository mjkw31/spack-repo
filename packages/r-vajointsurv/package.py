class RVajointsurv(RPackage):
	"""Variational Approximation for Joint Survival and Marker Models

	Estimates joint marker (longitudinal) and
	and survival (time-to-event) outcomes using variational approximations.
	The package supports multivariate markers allowing for
	correlated error terms and multiple types of survival outcomes which may be
	left-truncated, right-censored, and recurrent. Time-varying fixed and
	random covariate effects are supported along with non-proportional hazards.
