	"""Big Data Preprocessing Architecture

	
		Provide a tool to easily build customized data flows to pre-process large volumes 
	of information from different sources. To this end, 'bdpar' allows to (i) easily use and 
	create new functionalities and (ii) develop new data source extractors according to the 
	user needs. Additionally, the package provides by default a predefined data flow 
	to extract and pre-process the most relevant information (tokens, dates, ... ) from some textual 
	sources (SMS, Email, YouTube comments).
