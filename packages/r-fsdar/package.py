class RFsdar(RPackage):
	"""Robust Data Analysis Through Monitoring and Dynamic
Visualization

	Provides interface to the 'MATLAB' toolbox 'Flexible Statistical Data Analysis
	(FSDA)' which is comprehensive and computationally efficient
	software package for robust statistics in regression, multivariate
	and categorical data analysis. The current R version implements tools
	for regression: (forward search, S- and MM-estimation, least trimmed
	squares (LTS) and least median of squares (LMS)), for multivariate analysis
	(forward search, S- and MM-estimation), for cluster analysis and cluster-wise regression.
	The distinctive feature of our package is the possibility of
	monitoring the statistics of interest as a function of breakdown point,
	efficiency or subset size, depending on the estimator. This is
	accompanied by a rich set of graphical features, such as dynamic
	brushing, linking, particularly useful for exploratory data analysis.
