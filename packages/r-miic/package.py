	"""Learning Causal or Non-Causal Graphical Models Using Information
Theory

	We report an information-theoretic method which learns a large
	class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational
	data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly
	found in many datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method
	iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information
	contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences
	from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented
	based on the signature of causality in observational data. This approach can
	be applied on a wide range of datasets and provide new biological insights
	on regulatory networks from single cell expression data, genomic alterations
	during tumor development and co-evolving residues in protein structures.
