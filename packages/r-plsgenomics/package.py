class RPlsgenomics(RPackage):
	"""PLS Analyses for Genomics

	Routines for PLS-based genomic analyses,
        implementing PLS methods for classification with
        microarray data and prediction of transcription factor
        activities from combined ChIP-chip analysis. The >=1.2-1
        versions include two new classification methods for microarray
        data: GSIM and Ridge PLS. The >=1.3 versions includes a
        new classification method combining variable selection and
        compression in logistic regression context: logit-SPLS; and
        an adaptive version of the sparse PLS.
