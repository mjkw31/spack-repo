	"""Evaluation of the Role of Control Variables in Structural
Equation Models

	Various opportunities to evaluate the effects of including one or more control variable(s) in structural equation models onto model-implied variances, covariances, and parameter estimates. The derivation of the methodology employed in this package can be obtained from Bl√∂tner (2023) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/dy79z>.
