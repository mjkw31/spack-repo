class RBayessampling(RPackage):
	"""Bayes Linear Estimators for Finite Population

	Allows the user to apply the Bayes Linear approach to finite population with the Simple Random Sampling - BLE_SRS() - and
    the Stratified Simple Random Sampling design - BLE_SSRS() - (both without replacement), to the Ratio estimator (using auxiliary
    information) - BLE_Ratio() - and to categorical data - BLE_Categorical().
    The Bayes linear estimation approach is applied to a general linear regression model for finite population prediction in BLE_Reg()
    and it is also possible to achieve the design based estimators using vague prior distributions.
