	"""Computational Geometry

	R interface to (some of) cddlib
	(<https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib>).
	Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex polytope:
	as solution of a set of linear equalities and inequalities and as
	convex hull of set of points and rays.
	Also does linear programming and redundant generator elimination
	(for example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact
	infinite-precision rational arithmetic.
