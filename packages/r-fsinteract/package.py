class RFsinteract(RPackage):
	"""Fast Searches for Interactions

	Performs fast detection of interactions in large-scale data using the
	method of random intersection trees introduced in
	Shah, R. D. and Meinshausen, N. (2014) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/shah14a.html>. 
	The algorithm finds potentially high-order interactions in high-dimensional binary
	two-class classification data, without requiring lower order interactions
	to be informative.  The search is particularly fast when the matrices of
	predictors are sparse.  It can also be used to perform market basket analysis
	when supplied with a single binary data matrix.  Here it will find collections
	of columns which for many rows contain all 1's.
