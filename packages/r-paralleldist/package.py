class RParalleldist(RPackage):
	"""Parallel Distance Matrix Computation using Multiple Threads

	A fast parallelized alternative to R's native 'dist' function to
	calculate distance matrices for continuous, binary, and multi-dimensional
	input matrices, which supports a broad variety of 41 predefined distance
	functions from the 'stats', 'proxy' and 'dtw' R packages, as well as user-
	defined functions written in C++. For ease of use, the 'parDist' function
	extends the signature of the 'dist' function and uses the same parameter
	naming conventions as distance methods of existing R packages. The package
	is mainly implemented in C++ and leverages the 'RcppParallel' package to
	parallelize the distance computations with the help of the 'TinyThread'
	library. Furthermore, the 'Armadillo' linear algebra library is used for
	optimized matrix operations during distance calculations. The curiously
	recurring template pattern (CRTP) technique is applied to avoid virtual
	functions, which improves the Dynamic Time Warping calculations while
	the implementation stays flexible enough to support different DTW step
	patterns and normalization methods.
