class RDomino(RPackage):
	"""R Console Bindings for the 'Domino Command-Line Client'

	A wrapper on top of the 'Domino Command-Line Client'. It lets you
	run 'Domino' commands (e.g., "run", "upload", "download") directly from your
	R environment. Under the hood, it uses R's system function to run the 'Domino'
	executable, which must be installed as a prerequisite. 'Domino' is a service
	that makes it easy to run your code on scalable hardware, with integrated
	version control and collaboration features designed for analytical workflows
	(see <http://www.dominodatalab.com> for more information).
