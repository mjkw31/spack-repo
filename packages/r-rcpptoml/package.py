	"""'Rcpp' Bindings to Parser for Tom's Obvious Markup Language.

	The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to "Tom's Obvious
	Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
	<https://toml.io/en/>) suitable for both human editing as well as the
	common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
	connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle (in C++11) to R."""
