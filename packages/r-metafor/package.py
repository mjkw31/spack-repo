class RMetafor(RPackage):
	"""Meta-Analysis Package for R.

	A comprehensive collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses in R.
	The package includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome
	measures, fit equal-, fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such
	data, carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses, and create various
	types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe,
	Baujat, bubble, and GOSH plots). For meta-analyses of binomial and
	person-time data, the package also provides functions that implement
	specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method,
	and a variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e.,
	mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression models). Finally, the package
	provides functionality for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel
	models that account for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects
	(e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies, multiple
	endpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and
	meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to
	phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted. An introduction to the
	package can be found in Viechtbauer (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v036.i03>."""
