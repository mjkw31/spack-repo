class RDuckdbfs(RPackage):
	"""High Performance Remote File System Access Using 'duckdb'

	Provides friendly wrappers for creating 'duckdb'-backed connections
  to tabular datasets ('csv', parquet, etc) on local or remote file systems.
  This mimics the behaviour of "open_dataset" in the 'arrow' package, 
  but in addition to 'S3' file system also generalizes to any list of 'http' URLs.
