class RRcppalgos(RPackage):
	"""High Performance Tools for Combinatorics and Computational
Mathematics

	Provides optimized functions and flexible combinatorial iterators
	implemented in C++ for solving problems in combinatorics and
	computational mathematics. Utilizes the RMatrix class from 'RcppParallel'
	for thread safety. There are combination/permutation functions with
	constraint parameters that allow for generation of all results of a vector
	meeting specific criteria (e.g. generating integer partitions/compositions
	or finding all combinations such that the sum is between two bounds).
	Capable of generating specific combinations/permutations (e.g. retrieve
	only the nth lexicographical result) which sets up nicely for
	parallelization as well as random sampling. Gmp support permits exploration
	where the total number of results is large (e.g. comboSample(10000, 500,
	n = 4)). Additionally, there are several high performance number theoretic
	functions that are useful for problems common in computational mathematics.
	Some of these functions make use of the fast integer division library
	'libdivide'. The primeSieve function is based on the segmented sieve of
	Eratosthenes implementation by Kim Walisch. It is also efficient for large
	numbers by using the cache friendly improvements originally developed by
	Tom√°s Oliveira. Finally, there is a prime counting function that implements
	Legendre's formula based on the work of Kim Walisch.
