	"""R-Squared Measures for Multilevel Models

	Generates both total- and level-specific R-squared measures from
    Rights and Sterbaâ€™s (2019) <doi:10.1037/met0000184> framework of R-squared measures for multilevel
    models with random intercepts and/or slopes, which is based on a complete
    decomposition of variance. Additionally generates graphical 
    representations of these R-squared measures to allow visualizing and 
    interpreting all measures in the framework together as an integrated set.
    This framework subsumes 10 previously-developed R-squared measures for 
    multilevel models as special cases of 5 measures from the framework, and it
    also includes several newly-developed measures. Measures in the framework 
    can be used to compute R-squared differences when comparing multilevel 
    models (following procedures in Rights & Sterba (2020) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2019.1660605>).
    Bootstrapped confidence intervals can also be calculated. To use the 
    confidence interval functionality, download bootmlm from <https://github.com/marklhc/bootmlm>.
