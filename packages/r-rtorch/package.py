class RRtorch(RPackage):
	"""R Bindings to 'PyTorch'

	'R' implementation and interface of the Machine Learning platform 
	'PyTorch' <https://pytorch.org/> developed in 'Python'. It requires a 'conda'
	environment with 'torch' and 'torchvision' Python packages to provide 
	'PyTorch' functions, methods and classes. The key object in 'PyTorch' is the 
	tensor which is in essence a multidimensional array. These tensors are fairly 
	flexible in performing calculations in CPUs as well as 'GPUs' to accelerate 
	tensor operations.
