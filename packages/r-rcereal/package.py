	"""C++11 Header Files for 'cereal'

	To facilitate using 'cereal' with Rcpp.
	'cereal' is a header-only C++11 serialization library.
	'cereal' takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into
	different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML,
	or JSON. 'cereal' was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy
	to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily
	bundled with other code or used standalone. Please see
	<http://uscilab.github.io/cereal> for more information.
