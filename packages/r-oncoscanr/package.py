class ROncoscanr(RPackage):
	"""Secondary analyses of CNV data (HRD and more)

	The software uses the copy number segments from a text file and identifies all chromosome arms that are globally altered and computes various genome-wide scores. The following HRD scores (characteristic of BRCA-mutated cancers) are included: LST, HR-LOH, nLST and gLOH. the package is tailored for the ThermoFisher Oncoscan assay analyzed with their Chromosome Alteration Suite (ChAS) but can be adapted to any input.
