	"""NanoString Quality Control Dashboard

	NanoString nCounter data are gene expression assays
	where there is no need for the use of enzymes or amplification
	protocols and work with fluorescent barcodes (Geiss et al. (2018)
	<doi:10.1038/nbt1385>). Each barcode is assigned a
	messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA) which after bonding with its
	target can be counted. As a result each count of a specific barcode
	represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA. 'NACHO' (NAnoString
	quality Control dasHbOard) is able to analyse the exported NanoString
	nCounter data and facilitates the user in performing a quality
	control. 'NACHO' does this by visualising quality control metrics,
	expression of control genes, principal components and sample specific
	size factors in an interactive web application.
