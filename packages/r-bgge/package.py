	"""Bayesian Genomic Linear Models Applied to GE Genome Selection

	Application of genome prediction for a continuous variable, focused 
             on genotype by environment (GE) genomic selection models (GS). It consists a group of functions 
             that help to create regression kernels for some GE genomic models proposed by Jarqu√≠n et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/s00122-013-2243-1>
             and Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015) <doi:10.1534/g3.114.016097>. Also, it computes genomic predictions based on Bayesian approaches.
             The prediction function uses an orthogonal transformation of the data and specific priors
             present by Cuevas et al. (2014) <doi:10.1534/g3.114.013094>.
