	"""Inference in Randomized Controlled Trials with Death and
Missingness

	In randomized studies involving severely ill patients, functional
	outcomes are often unobserved due to missed clinic visits, premature
	withdrawal or death. It is well known that if these unobserved functional
	outcomes are not handled properly, biased treatment comparisons can be
	produced. In this package, we implement a procedure for comparing treatments
	that is based on the composite endpoint of both the functional outcome and
	survival. The procedure was proposed in Wang et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12594>
	and Wang et al. (2020) <DOI:10.18637/jss.v093.i12>. It considers missing data
	imputation with different sensitivity
	analysis strategies to handle the unobserved functional outcomes not due to
	death.
