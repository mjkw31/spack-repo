	"""High-Dimensional Metrics

	Implementation of selected high-dimensional statistical and
    econometric methods for estimation and inference. Efficient estimators and
    uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/
    structural parameters are provided which appear in high-dimensional
    approximately sparse models. Including functions for fitting heteroscedastic
    robust Lasso regressions with non-Gaussian errors and for instrumental variable
    (IV) and treatment effect estimation in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover,
    the methods enable valid post-selection inference and rely on a theoretically
    grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty.
