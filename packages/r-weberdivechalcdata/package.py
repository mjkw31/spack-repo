	Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from the locus coeruleus (LC) in postmortem human brain samples. Data were generated with the 10x Genomics Visium SRT and 10x Genomics Chromium snRNA-seq platforms. Datasets are stored in SpatialExperiment and SingleCellExperiment formats.
