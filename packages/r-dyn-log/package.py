class RDynLog(RPackage):
	"""Dynamic Logging for R Inspired by Configuration Driven
Development

	A comprehensive and dynamic configuration driven logging package for R. While there 
    are several excellent logging solutions already in the R ecosystem, I always feel constrained 
    in some way by each of them. Every project is designed differently to solve it's domain specific problem, 
    and ultimately the utility of a logging solution is its ability to adapt to this design. This is the 
    raison d'Ãªtre for 'dyn.log': to provide a modular design, template mechanics and a configuration-based 
    integration model, so that the logger can integrate deeply into your design, even though it knows 
    nothing about it.
