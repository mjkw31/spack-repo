	"""Statistical analysis of RNA editing sites and hyper-editing regions

	RNAeditr analyzes site-specific RNA editing events, as well as hyper-editing regions. The editing frequencies can be tested against binary, continuous or survival outcomes. Multiple covariate variables as well as interaction effects can also be incorporated in the statistical models.
