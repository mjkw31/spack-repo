	"""Modern Database Engine for Multi-Modal Data via Sparse and Dense
Multidimensional Arrays

	The modern database 'TileDB' introduces a powerful on-disk
 format for multi-modal data based on dimensional arrays. It supports
 dense and sparse arrays, dataframes and key-values stores, cloud
 storage ('S3', 'GCS', 'Azure'), chunked arrays, multiple compression,
 encryption and checksum filters, uses a fully multi-threaded
 implementation, supports parallel I/O, data versioning ('time
 travel'), metadata and groups. It is implemented as an embeddable
 cross-platform C++ library with APIs from several languages, and
 integrations.
