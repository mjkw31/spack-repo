	"""Selective k-Means

	Algorithms for solving selective k-means problem,
	which is defined as finding k rows in an m x n matrix such that 
	the sum of each column minimal is minimized. 
	In the scenario when m == n and each cell value in matrix is a 
	valid distance metric, this is equivalent to a k-means problem. 
	The selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the sense 
	that it is possible to have m != n, often the case m < n which 
	implies the search is limited within a small subset of rows. 
	Also, the selective k-means extends the k-means problem in the 
	sense that the instance in row set can be instance not seen in 
	the column set, e.g., select 2 from 3 internet service provider
	(row) for 5 houses (column) such that minimize the overall cost 
	(cell value) - overall cost is the sum of the column minimal of
	the selected 2 service provider.
