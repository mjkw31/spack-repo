	"""Exact Variable-Subset Selection in Linear Regression

	Exact and approximation algorithms for variable-subset
  selection in ordinary linear regression models.  Either compute all
  submodels with the lowest residual sum of squares, or determine the
  single-best submodel according to a pre-determined statistical
  criterion.  Hofmann et al. (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v093.i03>.
