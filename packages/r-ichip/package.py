	"""Bayesian Modeling of ChIP-chip Data Through Hidden Ising Models

	Hidden Ising models are implemented to identify enriched genomic regions in ChIP-chip data.  They can be used to analyze the data from multiple platforms (e.g., Affymetrix, Agilent, and NimbleGen), and the data with single to multiple replicates.
