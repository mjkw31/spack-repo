class RRgenometracks(RPackage):
	"""Integerated visualization of epigenomic data

	rGenomeTracks package leverages the power of pyGenomeTracks software with the interactivity of R. pyGenomeTracks is a python software that offers robust method for visualizing epigenetic data files like narrowPeak, Hic matrix, TADs and arcs, however though, here is no way currently to use it within R interactive session. rGenomeTracks wrapped the whole functionality of pyGenomeTracks with additional utilites to make to more pleasant for R users.
