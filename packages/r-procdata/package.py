class RProcdata(RPackage):
	"""Process Data Analysis

	Provides tools for exploratory process data analysis. Process data refers to the data describing
	participants' problem-solving processes in computer-based assessments. It is often recorded in computer
	log files. This package provides functions to read, process, and write process data. It also implements
	two feature extraction methods to compress the information stored in process data into standard 
	numerical vectors. This package also provides recurrent neural network based models that relate response processes 
	with other binary or scale variables of interest. The functions that involve training and evaluating neural networks 
	are wrappers of functions in 'keras'.
