class RQuantiseqr(RPackage):
	"""Quantification of the Tumor Immune contexture from RNA-seq data

	This package provides a streamlined workflow for the quanTIseq method, developed to perform the quantification of the Tumor Immune contexture from RNA-seq data. The quantification is performed against the TIL10 signature (dissecting the contributions of ten immune cell types), carefully crafted from a collection of human RNA-seq samples. The TIL10 signature has been extensively validated using simulated, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry data.
