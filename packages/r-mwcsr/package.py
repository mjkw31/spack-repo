class RMwcsr(RPackage):
	"""Solvers for Maximum Weight Connected Subgraph Problem and Its
Variants

	Algorithms for solving various Maximum
	Weight Connected Subgraph Problems, including variants with
	budget constraints, cardinality constraints, weighted edges and signals.
	The package represents an R interface to high-efficient solvers based on
	relax-and-cut approach (√Ålvarez-Miranda E., Sinnl M. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.cor.2017.05.015>)
	mixed-integer programming (Loboda A., Artyomov M., and Sergushichev A. (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-43681-4_17>)
	and simulated annealing.
