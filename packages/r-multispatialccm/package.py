	"""Multispatial Convergent Cross Mapping

	The multispatial convergent cross mapping algorithm can be used as a test for causal associations between pairs of processes represented by time series. This is a combination of convergent cross mapping (CCM), described in Sugihara et al., 2012, Science, 338, 496-500, and dew-drop regression, described in Hsieh et al., 2008, American Naturalist, 171, 71â€“80. The algorithm allows CCM to be implemented on data that are not from a single long time series. Instead, data can come from many short time series, which are stitched together using bootstrapping.
