	"""Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic
Interventions

	Efficient estimation of the population-level causal effects of
    stochastic interventions on a continuous-valued exposure. Both one-step and
    targeted minimum loss estimators are implemented for the counterfactual mean
    value of an outcome of interest under an additive modified treatment policy,
    a stochastic intervention that may depend on the natural value of the
    exposure. To accommodate settings with outcome-dependent two-phase
    sampling, procedures incorporating inverse probability of censoring
    weighting are provided to facilitate the construction of inefficient and
    efficient one-step and targeted minimum loss estimators.  The causal
    parameter and its estimation were first described by DÃ­az and van der Laan
    (2013) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01685.x>, while the multiply robust
    estimation procedure and its application to data from two-phase sampling
    designs is detailed in NS Hejazi, MJ van der Laan, HE Janes, PB Gilbert,
    and DC Benkeser (2020) <doi:10.1111/biom.13375>. The software package
    implementation is described in NS Hejazi and DC Benkeser (2020)
    <doi:10.21105/joss.02447>. Estimation of nuisance parameters may be
    enhanced through the Super Learner ensemble model in 'sl3', available for
    download from GitHub using 'remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3")'.
