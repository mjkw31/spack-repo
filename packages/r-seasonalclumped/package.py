class RSeasonalclumped(RPackage):
	"""Toolbox for Clumped Isotope Seasonality Reconstructions

	Compiles a set of functions and dummy data that simplify reconstructions of seasonal temperature
	 variability in the geological past from stable isotope and clumped isotope records in subâ€“annually resolved
	 carbonate archives (e.g. mollusk shells, corals and speleothems). For more information, see
	 de Winter et al., 2020 (Climate of the Past Discussions, <doi:10.5194/cp-2020-118>).
