class RGasanalyzer(RPackage):
	"""Import, Recompute and Analyze Data from Portable Gas Analyzers

	Provides functions to import data from several instruments
    commonly used by plant physiologists to measure characteristics
    related to photosynthesis. It provides a standardized list of variable
    names, and several sets of equations to calculate additional variables
    based on the measurements.  These equations have been described by von
    Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981) <doi:10.1007/BF00384257>, Busch et al.
    (2020) <doi:10.1038/s41477-020-0606-6> and MÃ¡rquez et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1038/s41477-021-00861-w>. In addition, this package
    facilitates performing sensitivity analyses on variables or
    assumptions used in the calculations.
