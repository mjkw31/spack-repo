class RRapparmor(RPackage):
	"""Bindings to AppArmor and Security Related Linux Tools

	Bindings to kernel methods for enforcing security restrictions. 
	AppArmor can apply mandatory access control (MAC) policies on a given task 
	(process) via security profiles with detailed ACL definitions. In addition
	this package implements bindings for setting process resource limits (rlimit),
	uid, gid, affinity and priority. The high level R function 'eval.secure' 
	builds on these methods to perform dynamic sandboxing: it evaluates a single
	R expression within a temporary fork which acts as a sandbox by enforcing 
	fine grained restrictions without affecting the main R process. A portable 
	version of this function is now available in the 'unix' package.
