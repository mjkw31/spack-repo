class RSimplesinglecell(RPackage):
	"""A step-by-step workflow for low-level analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data with Bioconductor

	Once a proud workflow package, this is now a shell of its former self. Almost all of its content has been cannibalized for use in the "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analyses with Bioconductor" book at https://osca.bioconductor.org. Most vignettes here are retained as reminders of the glory that once was, also providing redirection for existing external links to the relevant OSCA book chapters.
