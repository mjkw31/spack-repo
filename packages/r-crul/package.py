class RCrul(RPackage):
	"""HTTP Client.

	A simple HTTP client, with tools for making HTTP requests, and mocking HTTP
	requests. The package is built on R6, and takes inspiration from Ruby's
	'faraday' gem (<https://rubygems.org/gems/faraday>). The package name is a
	play on curl, the widely used command line tool for HTTP, and this package
	is built on top of the R package 'curl', an interface to 'libcurl'
	(<https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl>)."""
