class RTransport(RPackage):
	"""Computation of Optimal Transport Plans and Wasserstein Distances

	Solve optimal transport problems. Compute Wasserstein distances (a.k.a. Kantorovitch, Fortet--Mourier, Mallows, Earth Mover's, or minimal L_p distances), return the corresponding transference plans, and display them graphically. Objects that can be compared include grey-scale images, (weighted) point patterns, and mass vectors.
