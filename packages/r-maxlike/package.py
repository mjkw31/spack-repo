	"""Model Species Distributions by Estimating the Probability of
Occurrence Using Presence-Only Data

	Provides a likelihood-based approach to modeling species distributions using presence-only data. In contrast to the popular software program MAXENT, this approach yields estimates of the probability of occurrence, which is a natural descriptor of a species' distribution.
