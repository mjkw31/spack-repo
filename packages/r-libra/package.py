class RLibra(RPackage):
	"""Linearized Bregman Algorithms for Generalized Linear Models

	Efficient procedures for fitting the regularization path
	for linear, binomial, multinomial, Ising and Potts models with lasso,
	group lasso or column lasso(only for multinomial) penalty.
	The package uses Linearized Bregman Algorithm to solve the
	regularization path through iterations. Bregman Inverse Scale Space Differential
	Inclusion solver is also provided for linear model with lasso penalty.
