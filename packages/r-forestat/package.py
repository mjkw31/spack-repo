class RForestat(RPackage):
	"""Forest Carbon Sequestration and Potential Productivity
Calculation

	Include assessing site classes based on the stand height growth and establishing a nonlinear mixed-effect biomass model under different site classes based on the whole stand model to achieve more accurate estimation of carbon sequestration. In particular, a carbon sequestration potential productivity calculation method based on the potential mean annual increment is proposed. This package is applicable to both natural forests and plantations. It can quantitatively assess standâ€™s potential productivity, realized productivity, and possible improvement under certain site, and can be used in many aspects such as site quality assessment, tree species suitability evaluation, and forest degradation evaluation.
